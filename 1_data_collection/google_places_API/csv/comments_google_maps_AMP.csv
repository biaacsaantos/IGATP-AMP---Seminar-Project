Arouca,restaurante,Tasquinha da Quinta,IC,"I came here as part of a tour, and this restaurant saved the tour!  We had goat meat with potatoes and spinach, along with homemade bread.  The bread was unlike anything I've ever tasted before—so good!  The goat meat was incredibly fresh and tender; I was genuinely sad when I got full because I wanted to eat more.  Even though I'm staying in Gaia, I'll definitely make my way back to this restaurant to try more of their food!",10 months ago,5
Arouca,restaurante,Tasquinha da Quinta,Preetam Nath,"Has to be the most delicious veal I've had in my life. Probably the best meat I've ever had. Just look at the photos and let your mouth water haha. If you're in Arouca area, you must come here. We came with our tour guide and the place was packed.

Arouca,restaurante,Paiva à Vista,Svetlana Podkolzina,"I rarely write reviews but I felt the need to leave the comment for this restaurant for other people avoiding the deception.

We came for lunch on a public holiday, the lady (owner?) greeted us and said there were 3 plates to choose from (meat stew, codfish and something else), she did not present us the menu. We went for the meat stew for 3 of us, not worrying about checking the prices in the menu for it, because I saw the price list on the wall next to the entrance and it stated 8€ for a portion and 5€ per 1/2 portion, quite reasonable. The meat was OK, definitely not 3 1/2 portions (we just came from the North of Portugal and we know how generous 1/2 portions can be!) but we were satisfied. The surprise came with the bill where we were presented with 43€ to pay for the meat (25€ per full portion and 18€ for 1/2 portion). And of course, they do not accept cards, very convenient knowing that the closest ATM is miles away.",a year ago,2

Settled in the middle of a thousand years old houses somewhere nowhere.
It was a privilege to visit a place like this where modernity is paired with traditional architecture.
The food was all made from scratch. Homemade smoked sausages, awesome prosciutto and cheese. Meat was super tasty and the bacalhao cooked to perfection. Don't get me wrong: this is not a michelin star place but it's food that's cooked under the laws of old traditions and with wisdom and good taste. And also: try to eat the less possible before going there and keep space in your belly. And on top of it all we paid 100 EUR including TWO bottles of wine for 3 persons all together.

The interior is very unwelcoming, so we asked to sit outside. None of the waiters spoke any English. They had 4 main dishes on the menu, but 'forced' us into Alvarenga steak, as we kind of understood they had nothing else. Then he brought out some starters without us ordering them. The Alvarenga steak itself was in parts not done at all and bit chewy. Generally the food was really mediocre.

After our experience at this place where we were served probably some of the worst food in our lives we were very surprised how is it possible this place has such high reviews. This confusion was cleared out when the staff of this establishment added three five star reviews to cover our one star (maybe don’t have your picture in google profile if you are goong to rate your own place, pathetic). Probably most of these reviews are completely fake judging on how they are written. HORRIBLE food, the meat smelled FOUL, they charged me more than was stated price in the menu and wanted to argue with me that the higher price is written on a different menu.

The monastic building constituted by the church, choir, cloisters, dormitories and fence, was classified as a National Monument in 1910.

The current construction was built from the late seventeenth century and the next century. It overlapped all existing buildings and erased all previous architectural structures that were built from the tenth century.

In the thirteenth century, the Holy Queen Mafalda, turned the monastery to the Cistercian rule, and changing the name to the Monastery of Santa Maria de Arouca. The quality of its architecture, and the complementary arts, is justified by the high socio-cultural strata of the nuns who lived in it.",4 years ago,5

Arouca,museu,Museu Municipal de Arouca,Pedro Jorge Pereira ECO,"Para quem se sente apaixonado pela história, assim como pelo estudo e reconhecimento das nossas raízes, em particular do nosso património rural, o Museu Municipal de Arouca é um local capaz de nos fazer sentir profundamente felizes.

Centrado naturalmente no território de Arouca, permite-nos fazer uma viagem por alguns dos períodos mais marcantes da nossa histórica enquanto país e, até muito antes disso, enquanto território.

Para além disso possui um acervo verdadeiramente fascinante relativo às práticas, conhecimentos e tradições do nosso povo, nomeadamente do povo habituado à vida árdua e exigente da montanha. Ainda assim repleta de sabedoria, tradições e em geral de um profundo respeito pela Natureza à qual se encontravam intrinsecamente ligados.

E o que é um povo sem conhecimento da sua história e raízes? É talvez um povo à deriva nas modas e marés desta globalização “standart”.

Para quem adora a floresta e a montanha, oferece-nos também diversos elementos informativos muito importantes que nos permitem conhecer de forma mais profunda as dinâmicas e história associadas a essas questões. Em particular no que ao tema da “Floresta” diz respeito (quando visitei estava patente uma exposição muito interessante sobre as Campanhas de Florestação do Estado Novo que constituíram inicialmente um sério revés para o sistema de gestão comunitário dos baldios)

Mas muito mais do que grandes descrições, a principal “nota” que posso deixar é a do quanto enriquecedor se revela o tempo despendido numa visita ao Museu Municipal de Arouca e, além do mais, porque não fazer dessa visita um excelente ponto de partida para explorar mais a fundo o território tão particular e mágico da Serra da Freita?

Arouca,hotel,Hotel São Pedro,Samuel Almeida,"The town of Arouca is nothing compared to the metropolitan cities of Lisboa or Porto. However, Hotel S. Pedro makes your stay in the town worthwhile.

Well located in the city, the hotel doesn't offer a majestic entrance that takes your breath away. However, the service is welcoming.

When entering the room (I stayed in a 2 single-bed room) I encountered a modern and comfortable room. There was sufficient 'moving around space' despite the two beds. The bathroom was also large but didn't offer all those little luxuries (but it's only a three star hotel).

I had breakfast, lunch and dinner there during two nights. Breakfast was what you'd expect from a 3***. Everything you need was offered except for the less healthy bacon and eggs :) Lunch and dinner service was for a group and not 'à la carte'. However, the service was once again plentiful and tateful.

Arouca,hotel,Villa Tavares suites,chris jowett,"We took two rooms for one night, my wife and myself in one, our daughter in the other.

There were a couple of issues. Our window blind motor and workings were exposed as the panel was missing. More importantly my daughter could not open her door/window at all, so slept with no ventilation.

In the morning I took a shower and the water was cold, so I had to make do with a rather unsatisfactory stand up “cold swill” at the bathroom basin.

When we were checking out I discovered my daughter had done exactly the same, but her long hair couldn’t be washed and she was very far from being a happy bunny!

I told the manager, Patricia, who was sympathetic as you might expect but when I suggested that she might consider some financial compensation she held back, saying she would have to ask the boss and get back to me.

This was our second visit, so we were return guests and could possibly have been considered favourably.....

After 2 days there was no response so I emailed her, but no response so I phoned her...Oh she didn’t get the email.

... But the boss had said no.

I told her I was going to write a review regarding the issue, she contacted the boss again and he then agreed to giving us one room free of charge.

I sent my bank details and waited 3 days

No money was transferred so I started emailing and phoning for a week. There were no email responses and her phone went straight to “try again later”.

So...we have the water issue which of course could happen anywhere.
Then we have an intransigent management who don’t consider (return) customer satisfaction as important.... until threatened.
Then we have a lying management who say they will give recompense but do not.
Then we have a totally unresponsive management hiding behind the email and telephone system, hoping we will go away.

I won’t.... but hopefully you will consider another hotel.",a year ago,1

Nevertheless the owner found me a cottage room for me and my dog which was excellent. They could have turned me away then and there but they found me a room and accommodated me.

Absolutely superb attitude and service.

And the breakfast as well is very, very good - this is. 5 star breakfast. They obviously care and want their guests leaving with a very positive experience.

Arouca,hotel,Hotel Rural Vale Do Rio,Maurice Gelissen,"We booked a room for just 1 night as a little romantic getaway during our holiday in Portugal. Upon arrival the peaceful area in which the hotel is located really soaks you into an relaxing mood. We were welcomed by friendly staff and even tho we arrived a little early, they made sure that our room was clean and ready for us. The room is very clean, nicely decorated and breaths the peaceful environment of the area. The spa facilities are great, we were lucky to have them all to ourselfs. There is an indoor pool, turkish steam sauna, jacuzzi and sauna. Right outside the pool area is enough space to soak up the sun on one of the chairs, a bar and a children playground. The hotel offers a library, pooltable, restaurant, roomservice, minibar, lounge area and enough activities which can be booked as an extra for your stay. Breakfast is included in each booking.

Our overall experience is that this was the perfect getaway to really enjoy the peace and eachother.",8 months ago,5

Arouca,hotel,Quinta do Pedregal Hotel & SPA,Hélder Moreira,"A very pleasant stay for a, romantic or not, weekend getaway.

First of all, a note to mention that the staff was all incredibly helpful and pleasant. From the moment we checked in until we checked out everyone received us with a smile and seemed eager to please us.

The hotel and spa itself are good too. Modern, cozy and clean. We stayed in what I think is probably the smallest bungalow — it was fine, but not memorable.
The spa was clean and pleasant too. We didn’t use the outdoor jacuzzi due to rainy conditions which was a shame — perhaps next time.

The location of the hotel is okay. 20-30 mins to Porto or Gaia so not too bad. The fact that it is in the middle of a residential area breaks the “illusion” a little bit but it is what it is.",a month ago,4

Arouca,hotel,Octant Hotels Douro,Vicente Russo,"It is a beautiful location by the Douro River for this modern and stylish hotel. The room is very well-appointed, and the bathroom is huge. Raiva Michelin restaurant is a culinary experience not to be missed. BUT...

families with kids are allowed everywhere, so if you are a couple trying to have a relaxing getaway with your significant other, the stay at the Octant Douro can become a nightmare. There is no quiet area for those without children - a common practice at resorts around the world - so you are exposed to the family madness everywhere in the property.

The inside pool in the spa area, with the sauna and the water treatments, would be a lovely and relaxing space for adults. Still, during our stay, this place was swamped by families with screaming children jumping in the pool; without any supervision from the hotel's staff, the area turned into a mob scene. Even during dinner at the Michelin restaurant, we were exposed to crying babies and children screaming throughout our dinner.

So keep this in mind before booking a stay here.",4 months ago,3

Arouca,hotel,VistaFreita,Monika F.,"Miałam przyjemność spędzić kilka dni w VistaFreita, i poznać włascicieli Macário i Anabelę, i mogę z całego serca polecić to miejsce każdemu, kto szuka komfortowego i przytulnego noclegu.

Pokoje pięknie urządzone, co sprawiło, że poczułam się jak w domu. Wnętrze było schludne, czyste i starannie wyposażone we wszystkie niezbędne udogodnienia. Kuchnia była doskonale zaopatrzona, co umożliwiło mi swobodne przygotowywanie posiłków.

Lokalizacja VistaFreita jest znakomita – blisko do lokalnych atrakcji, ale jednocześnie zapewnia spokój i ciszę, idealne do relaksu po dniu pełnym zwiedzania. Widoki z okien były po prostu oszałamiające i dostarczały niezapomnianych chwili.
Po sąsiedzku mały kościółek, który przypomina nam co kwadrans, która godzina. To było fantastyczne i w ogóle nie zaburzało ciszy, takie krótkie bicie dzwonów to folklor lokalny który dodaje niepowtarzalnego charakteru temu miejscu. Czułam się tam naprawdę dobrze, jakby czas zwolnił...

Pan Macário i pani Anabela to prawdziwe perełki w świecie gospodarzy. Ich gościnność, troska o szczegóły i chęć pomocy sprawiły, że mój pobyt był jeszcze bardziej przyjemny. Zawsze służyli radą i byli dostępni, by odpowiedzieć na moje pytania.

Ogólnie rzecz biorąc zdecydowanie polecam to miejsce każdemu, kto planuje wizytę w tej okolicy. Być może wrócę tam przy okazji kolejnych podróży!

Arouca,hotel,Rio moment's,Hans Dirkse,"Location great, hotel perfect, staff extremely friendly.
Our flight was delayed. We expected to arrive at the hotel by car between 10:30 PM and 11:00 PM. Actual time of arrival became 01:30 AM. The drive from the airport was easy, especially the first 40 km, then regional roads, winding but easy to drive. But then the last 3 km on the EM503, in the dark. Without navigation you think – I'll turn around. And when passing the small church you definitely wonder  – where do I end up? But finally - after the umpteenth bend - we are there. Despite the late hour, Ana is patiently waiting for us. Welcomes us and takes all the time to help us unload and get settled. Compliments. In daylight you can fully enjoy the surroundings and (in nice weather) have breakfast on the balcony. And experience the small and winding roads in a different perspective. A great place to stay. We had room 00 with its own terrace. Most of the time perfect weather, only last couple of days distant wildfires blocked sunshine and you could smell it somewhat. Please note - this location is less suitable if you have problems walking, due to the sloping and uneven roads and paths.

The location is secluded and reached by  narrow roads which discourage traveling in the dark. Fortunately, breakfast is included and they serve a very affordable four course meal with wine. Don't miss the second longest pedestrian suspension bridge in the world. It was an exciting experience crossing the gorge high above the river below. You will be happy you stayed at Rio Moment's.

Arouca,hotel,Syntony Hotels - Paradinha Village,A,"I really liked this property. My main complaint is the terrible lighting around the property and on the stairs. I almost fell twice and so did someone else in our group, just trying to walk down stairs from the reception. Even the staff were using their feet to cover the blinding in floor lighting and using the phones to guide. They need to implement simple light cover deflectors to solve this problem.

The only other issue is the drive at night in the rain can be challenging. With the road being quite tight for two cars trying to pass each other.

Views are amazing. The construction is nice I really like the raw cement look. Each bungalow well distanced from each other. Nice fireplace in the room.

Arouca,hotel,Syntony Hotels - Paradinha Village,Joeleao073 1 (joeleao073),"Stunning Hotel! Perfect for escaping the hustle and bustle of city life.
Syntony Hotels - Paradinha Village is situated in a serene rural part of Portugal near Arouca, offering a wonderfully tranquil and calm atmosphere.

The rooms feature an industrial style that blends seamlessly with the surrounding environment, creating a harmonious and soothing ambiance that effortlessly melts away stress.

The views from the hotel rooms are absolutely breathtaking, nestled in a valley between two hillsides. The lush vegetation and the soothing sound of the nearby river create a wonderfully relaxing ambiance, perfect for rejuvenating your energy.

On hot summer days, the hotel provides a refreshing saltwater pool for guests to cool off. For those seeking a more ""natural"" experience, the nearby Paiva river is just a short five-minute walk away and offers an excellent spot for a swim.

While the hotel does not have an on-site restaurant, they do offer a convenient ""home delivery"" service, allowing guests to order typical Portuguese cuisine dishes from a nearby restaurant and have them delivered right to their doorsteps.

The breakfast served at the hotel is a delightful representation of Portuguese cuisine, featuring sweet pastries, yogurt, cheese & ham, as well as bread, coffee, and tea. Personally, I found it to be tasty and delicious.

The only slight ""drawback,"" if it can be called one, is the access to the hotel. It is advisable to have a car or arrange transportation. The narrow mountain road leading to the hotel has occasional steep inclines that unexperinced drivers might have difficulties managing.
However, this should not deter you from experiencing a wonderful time at Syntony Hotels - Paradinha Village!",a year ago,5

Arouca,hotel,Quinta do Pomar Maior,Marcos Teixeira,"Overall a near perfect experience. The property is very pretty with a rustic feel almost an industrial chique (sometimes makes you wonder if by design or accident). Expect to cross paths with several types of bugs. The access is honestly very bad. A very tight street in which two cars don't cross can make for some very challenging reversing situations (I suggest installing a motion detection traffic light the style you see in underground Lisbon parking lots) and the gate to the property is in a very inclined slippery cobble stone. Definitely not friendly for lower or exotic cars.

Still, all this becomes almost meaningless or at least negligible when compared to the service. The staff is warm and welcome, catering to every need. The breakfast is nothing short of amazing, putting many four star hotels from major chains to shame. The location is great, close to Arouca, and even in the off season, under heavy rain it's a pleasant space to be in. I believe in the summer the pool is very inviting.

I can't compare it to other venues in the area but I believe everyone would be satisfied with Quinta do Pomar Maior and with some small improvements it can deliver the perfect Alojamento Local experience.

The walk from the river to the suspension bridge is not too difficult and well worth the effort. We did not go past the bridge because we started late.

In the cold months, it's better to get there early, because the shades of the afternoon bring the cold with them.

The waterfall is amazing and the walk over the bridge is breathtaking and unique. The suspended bridge was finished in 2021, so it's relatively new. It's almost 600 meters long, and passes 170 meters above the river. You can only cross it with a guided tour leaving the station at its entrance a few times a day, and you'll have to pay online.",a year ago,5

Paisagem incrível do contraste das dunas com a floresta de pinheiros e arbustos, o passeio é relaxante e muito espetacular. É preciso pegar o autocarro ""Forte da barra"" que passa na Lourenço peixinho ou então pegar ele na estação rodoviária de Aveiro, descer no ponto Forte da barra (ferry). É preciso pegar a balsa para atravessar o mar. Descendo da balsa é possível seguir o caminho pelo Google maps que aparece se colocar na busca: 'Reserva natural de São Jacinto'. Foi um pouco difícil saber se estávamos no caminho certo, mas seguindo o caminho apontado no GPS você encontra primeiro a placa escrito 'Reserva São Jacinto' e vai reto por muito tempo, até uma hora encontrar um piso de madeira atravessando a estrada, você pode seguir tanto para a direita como pela esquerda, ou continuar reto que você conseguirá achar esse caminho da ponte que leva até a costa e a praia de dunas.
Na minha opinião poderia ter mais placas explicando os caminhos e rotas para chegar lá, pois fomos nos aventurando para chegar no local sem saber ao certo para onde estávamos indo.
É uma caminhada um pouco longa então é apropriado sapatos confortáveis e garrafa de água. O caminho na reserva é todo em solo arenoso, então pode ser que entre bastante areia no seu tênis.
A paisagem ao final da ponte é de outro mundo, vale muito a pena a caminhada. Depois pode se explorar essas outras rotas que existem por lá.",6 years ago,5

If you want (but not mandatory for the hike) you can cross the 516 Arouca bridge, which is the second longest suspended footbridge in the world (definitely worth it!).

Arouca,praia,São Jacinto Beach,Stefan Bostock,"Probably one of the best beaches I’ve ever been to. Vast, wild, and empty (there were around 10 other people visible on the beach in later September). Could have watched the crashing building-sized waves indefinitely. They were so mesmerising that my partner passed out face down on the sand almost immediately. Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

The walk from the river to the suspension bridge is not too difficult and well worth the effort. We did not go past the bridge because we started late.

In the cold months, it's better to get there early, because the shades of the afternoon bring the cold with them.

The waterfall is amazing and the walk over the bridge is breathtaking and unique. The suspended bridge was finished in 2021, so it's relatively new. It's almost 600 meters long, and passes 170 meters above the river. You can only cross it with a guided tour leaving the station at its entrance a few times a day, and you'll have to pay online.",a year ago,5

Arouca,praia,Hotel São Pedro,Samuel Almeida,"The town of Arouca is nothing compared to the metropolitan cities of Lisboa or Porto. However, Hotel S. Pedro makes your stay in the town worthwhile.

Well located in the city, the hotel doesn't offer a majestic entrance that takes your breath away. However, the service is welcoming.

When entering the room (I stayed in a 2 single-bed room) I encountered a modern and comfortable room. There was sufficient 'moving around space' despite the two beds. The bathroom was also large but didn't offer all those little luxuries (but it's only a three star hotel).

I had breakfast, lunch and dinner there during two nights. Breakfast was what you'd expect from a 3***. Everything you need was offered except for the less healthy bacon and eggs :) Lunch and dinner service was for a group and not 'à la carte'. However, the service was once again plentiful and tateful.

In general, one can't resume the hotel to its four walls. The hotel is just half of the experience of the town and its surroundings. However, those that stay just for the night won't leave disappointed.",9 years ago,4

Chocolate mousse was too artificial and too sweet for my liking but that was my own choice. Wine is mostly local and couldn’t feel a difference between 4 euro one and 7.50 one (for a small 0.375 L bottle). What it probably means is that 4 euro wine is pretty good for most of us. Vegetables were boiled to perfection. Great food, fast and efficient service. They do accept cc and do speak English.

Sardinas were okay, there were like six of 'em in half dose, accompanied with a couple of oversalted potatoes. Again, no lemon.
The worst part is the service and vibes. Personnel is up to their own business, I've waited for almost 20 mins just to get a menu.
Price is the same as in Porto - quite high for a small place like this.

started to eat it) and been interrupted as waitress  brought  another plate of fish  saying that was the right,  we were  very confused by this kind of behaviour, before that brought soup that we even  didn't order.
Roasted octopus with roasted potatoes (25 euro) i have ordered came oversalted impossible
to eat,with  tasteless garnish, cod fish came ovesalted as well. For the record tried octopus in Portugal before and not only and know how it should taste when cooked to perfection. We paid 71 euro  total but food was barely touched as it tasted horrible. Its is not what you expect from highly scoured restaurant located by the ocean in Portugal ordering sea food.

Espinho,hotel,Exe Praia Golfe,Aleksandra Kozera,"I do not recommend staying at this hotel. While some aspects, such as the beachfront location, are promising, the overall experience was overwhelmingly negative. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problems we encountered during our stay:

1. Bar Service:
On our first night, I went to the bar for a drink, but no staff were present. I waited 15 minutes and eventually called reception. Although someone was ""on their way,"" no one arrived, and the receptionist had to pour the drink herself after 20 min of wait. Again, I was tired really looking forward to a friday one drink at the bar and such hussle spoils your weekend.

2. Room Issues:

The windows and balcony were extremely dirty. There was no toilet brushes. Inagine travelling with three small children - disgusting.

The TV did not work as advertised and could not connect to Netflix or other platforms we chose the hotel for, as it was a ""yes-day"" for our kids.

When I approached the receptionist for help, I was treated dismissively, as if I were at fault. Someone was sent to fix it, but this led to an even bigger issue—two men entered our room without knocking, disrupting our family time.

3. Spa Facilities:

The spa area felt abandoned, with no staff available to assist.

The swimming pool was accessible, but the saunas were off, and there was nobody to ask about turning them on.

The overpowering smell of chlorine burned our eyes.

The windows were so dirty that the views, which were the hotel's selling point, were obscured.

Spa Treatments: The receptionist also doubles as the masseuse, making it nearly impossible to book a treatment. She could only be contacted between her sessions, which was a logistical nightmare. I was eagerly anticipating a spa treatment—a rare indulgence during my travels—but it never happened. She messaged me on the day of my departure at 7 p.m., long after I had left the hotel.

4. Breakfast:

The breakfast selection was dismal—no vegetables, not even a single piece of tomato or cucumber.

The pastries and eggs were terrible in quality, and the overall options were extremely limited.

The room lacked a kettle, which meant I couldn’t even prepare boiled water, something I enjoy.

5. Hotel Maintenance:

One of the elevators was broken, resulting in long waits to go up or down.

There was no toilet brush in the bathroom, which is a basic amenity and a glaring oversight.

6. Location:

While the hotel is located by the beach, which is undeniably beautiful, the surrounding area feels like a ghost town from the 1980s—abandoned and unsettling.

Final Thoughts:
Despite some modernist design elements and the beachside setting, this hotel is poorly managed and neglected. From basic cleanliness and service to functional amenities, the experience was far below expectations. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone seeking comfort, quality, or a memorable stay.",4 months ago,2
Espinho,hotel,Exe Praia Golfe,V R,"TLDR: Not recommended. If you decide to stay at Exe hotels, be sure to call and verify that all advertised services are available, they don't warn about anything themselves.

Wanted to edit my review on Booking, but unfortunately it's impossible, so decided to leave another review on Google Maps. Chose this hotel for the SPA, stayed for one day, traveled from another city. Booked a room for three through Booking. During booking and at check-in, no one informed that the SPA wasn't working and was under renovation. No compensations were offered at reception on check-in day. The vacation was ruined. Only after we left a negative review on Booking did hotel representatives (Diogo V.) contact me and offer a discount on the next booking. However, after two weeks, no discount was provided, they stopped responding to my emails without explaining why.",3 months ago,1

Espinho,hotel,Hotel Apartamento Solverde,Emma Mc,"Really helpful staff, we arrived late on Sunday and no problems at all with late check in. 2 adults and 3 children shared a two double bed apartment with a bed/couch in the main living area. Kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook and a good size fridge with ice-box, toaster, kettle and microwave. Separate sink to hand wash clothes and rack to dry them on. Really clean and towels/kitchen equipment provided. Espinho is a lovely town with lots of restaurants and coffee shops plus the casino and bars. The beach is fantastic , clean and great for surfing/walking/football/volleyball or just chilling with a book. The cycle path runs all the way to Porto. Great access to the roads if you want to travel further afield with Porto only 25 mins away. We visited lots of places by car and had a lovely time. Highly recommended this apartment hotel, really great location, clean, fabulous staff and great for families. The only problem was the location of plug sockets in the bedrooms , there was only one in each and they were in strange not accessible places BUT using an extension will solve this. Definitely will come here again if we're in Espinho.

Espinho,hotel,Hotel Apartamento Solverde,Begun65 Vdal,"Quite an old hotel (but all clean) I am staying during my customer contacts. Good to have the kitchen and nearby supermarket. Sea is near but usually got no time left to walk, run or swim.
Returned to Solverde in August 2022 after 3 years not using due to pandemics- breakfast got worse. Think to not use their breakfast during my next stay but to eat in my room.",2 years ago,4
Espinho,hotel,Hotel Apartamento Solverde,Colin B,"I am reluctant to give this five stars because everyone will want to go here! I think this is a marvelous place to stay a really convenient location, a short train ride into Porto if you want. The facilities themselves are clean and comfortable what more can you ask for? Oh, the staff - marvelous.

Update October 2018 - I just had another lovely stay here. I was on the 12th floor and the general floor finish was wood laminate (the tired carpet has been replaced). The WiFi in the apartment was more than adequate and as usual the staff were friendly and helpful. A kettle in the kitchen would be good but otherwise I think this place is wonderful value for money. I will be returning that's for sure.

Update May 2022 - All as above BUT they must read Google maps comments because a kettle is now provided.",2 years ago,5

Espinho,hotel,19 Nineteen Suites,arualmin,"I strongly advise against staying in this accommodation. It is the noisiest place in Espinho, during the day and at night, since, just below is a bakery that is open every day until 3:30 a.m. and is the hangout of Espinho teenagers who yell, sing, etc. until late at night. Two nights I had to call the police, as did other neighbors, as told by the police themselves. I was in Espinho 5 days for work and never slept more than 4-5 hours a night.

Espinho,hotel,Hotel M,Pedro Gustavo Torres,"The hotel is as simple as you can get. If I'm traveling alone and for work purposes I would say that this place is ok... And with the train station in front (don't worry, you don't hear the train) it can be quite handy. Now if you travel as a couple or with kids... Then I would recommend to pay a bit more and go to a better place.
The breakfast is also very very simple (almost disappointing) and the room isn't that comfortable... As soon as I finish my meal I left because the space wasn't inviting or confy.
Last but not least the bedroom's bathroom is very small... Which is far from ideal (at least to me).

Espinho,hotel,Hotel Solverde Spa & Wellness Center,A B,"We did not have a good time at this hotel - we stayed 5 nights here and could not wait  to go home. The hotel had no air-conditioning only heat, the rooms were so stuffy, had no air in, had to leave balcony door open but the trains were going by constantly behind the hotel and it was so noisy. There is no insulation between rooms, you could hear everything next doors, we had to change room first because a noisy group of men were beside us in the rooms and they were partying all night, then we got a family of 4 besides us and we could ever hear when they were bathing and using toilets etc, getting up at 6pm. Holiday in hell. Definetly not 5 star. We asked to leave as we could not get a good night sleep but we were told they would not refund any of the remaining nights, I mean it was not cheap, €150 a night, for us was not an option to leave and get different hotel elsewhere. The only thing could of have been enjoyable is the spa and they have sauna/Turkish bath area for men and women separately  but screaming  kids were running in and out of it, men were coming in to the ladies rooms, it should of have been a relaxing area but no staff on board to control these situations so even this was not enjoyable.",4 months ago,1

Reasonable train transport into Porto 15- 20 min walk from the hotel, and there may be hotel arranged transport as well.

I recently stayed at a lovely hotel in the small town of Espinho, near Porto, Portugal, and had an unforgettable experience. The hotel is located right on the oceanfront, offering breathtaking views of the sea.

A special thanks to the host, Diogo, for his exceptional hospitality. Every day, he brought us delicious pastries from the local bakery, adding a personal and delightful touch to our mornings.

The sunsets over the ocean were simply incredible, creating magical evenings that we will always remember. We are already planning to return many more times.

During the whole visit you are taken care of. Starting from recommendations where it’s better to eat or make shopping and ending with being given a wind shield so that you can feel comfortable at the beach at a windy day.

Everything is very neat and clean and for breakfast you have freshly baked bread every day. The hostel location is also great - 5 minutes from the train station and 5 minutes to the beach and restaurants area. So I highly recommend this place and definitely will come back",2 years ago,5

The location was in a quieter part of Espinho but there were plenty of restaurants, bars and beach bars near the guest house and on the walk into the main part of the resort.

If you are looking for an anonymous, hotel style atmosphere, you probably shouldn't come here.

But if you like a nice chat with the hosts, enjoy their home cooked dinners (something else every night, costs extra, but is not expensive), like a home far away from home, with a pool, a nice backyard, cosy rooms and a walk to the beach, that has several places to eat or drink, and LOTS of sand, dunes and waves, then you are at the right place.

We certainly had a good and very relaxed time. If we go on holidays in the area again, this is a sure stop.",7 months ago,5

Furthermore, Pedro, the owner, lives upstairs and is always making sure everything goes well. He recommended places to visit and where to eat.  The beach is literally a 3 minute walk away.  You can park for free in the surroundings. On the beach you can surf (for €30 for half a day or so). There are cheap places to eat/dine right on the beach. It is not very touristy, quiet.

Es un edificio estrechito y muy nuevo y en cada planta hay una habitación que se accede por escaleras A la entrada hay una pequeña recepción con vasos, agua y cafetera, cucharillas y azúcar. Nuestra planta era la 3á y tenía aire acondicionado, una cama de matrimonio muy confortable de 1.35 con una mininevera, 2 tazas, boles, platos, cubiertos, servilletas y cápsulas de te y café para la cafetera de recepción. Un armario y una tv plana. La habitación muy cómoda y nueva. La dueña nos dejó bombones y 2 botellss de agua, que es de agradecer. El cuarto de baño muy completo, con plato de ducha y 3 botes con gel, champú y acondicionador. Una pequeña terraza con 2 sillas y una mesa baja.
La zona es tranquila exceptuando algún momento puntual por las mañanas en q los perros del vecindario ladran. La habitación está muy bien aislada, sólo se oye con la terraza abierta.

Pros:
- La relación calidad/precio.
- Muy nuevo, confortable, acogedor.
- La dueña muy amable, detallista y siempre pendiente de nuestras necesidades.
- Es muy fácil aparcar al lado del alojamiento.
Contras:
- No está en el centro del pueblo ni en primera línea de playa, aun q sí está cerca: Al centro son 10min escasos y para ir a la playa hay q atravesar las vías del tren para lo cuál hay 2 opciones: la más cercana es una pasarela, pero huele a orines y por la noche no es muy fiable. La otra opción es andar 5min y pasar por encima, ya q llegando a la estación la vía de tren está soterrada.

Espinho,hotel,Casa do Engenho,Sónia Exposto,"D. Céu, a dona, muito desagradável quando recebemos uma visita de familiares que a tinham contactado previamente a solicitar autorização para se juntarem a nós por algumas horas.
Na realidade desde o início da estadia percebi alguns pormenores que fui desvalorizando no sentido de tornar os dias agradáveis, pois a minha família foi realizar tratamentos nas Caldas de S.Jorge. Quando fiz a reserva por telefone questionei qual a distância a pé para as termas e a resposta da D. Céu foi 5 a 7 minutos a pé o que constatei ser falso logo no primeiro dia, são pelo menos 20/25 minutos o que com idosos se pode tornar muito difícil. Os quartos e os espaços comuns não têm rede telefónica com WiFi inconstante.
Só limpam os quartos de 4 em 4 dias, o que com um acesso em terra batida implica que o chão está sempre sujo. A falta de manutenção nas casas de banho dos quartos provoca falta de papel higiénico.
A sala de refeições nunca foi limpa em condições nos 12 dias que lá estivemos.
Pequeno almoço sem variedade, com poucos produtos.
Mas o pior mesmo foi a forma agressiva, de dedo apontado em riste, dirigida a mim quando os meus familiares (4 pessoas) entraram na sala de refeições junto á porta, ocupando a mesa habitualmente destinada á minha família e aí permaneceram um curto espaço de tempo, de forma ordeira, até serem expulsos para o exterior.

Everything had a home made touch that made it taste a lot better.

Gondomar,restaurante,Sucesso dos Grelhados,Lia G,"Super popular restaurant (multiple baptism / communion events happening on the weekend) but I believe this is mostly down to the view.
We arrived at lunchtime on the weekend and despite how busy the restaurant was and our group size (8 plus baby) we were seated quickly. That's when it started going downhill.
I ordered a salmon with my MIL and other people in our group ordered meat dishes to share.
While the traditional bread/olive starters etc were on the table very quickly the cod croquettes were dry and you could tell had been out for a while waiting to be served.
We had over an hours wait for our mains due to the wait for the salmon to be cooked. I believe it was cooked from frozen as salmon only takes 15 mins to cook. On top of that people that arrived long after us were served before us. When it finally arrived you could tell it wasn't fresh and it definitely wasn't cooked on a barbecue grill. There was no smell of a traditional outdoor grill or a taste of a meal cooked on charcoal. The salmon was tough and bland.
The toilets were poorly maintained and there was no baby change facilities.
The dessert offering was poor and given the mains I would guess not freshly made in house. They obviously had the traditional mousse and cheesecake offerings which didn't look appetising.

Overall a hyped up restaurant only popular because of its spectacular views. And probably one or two meat dishes that make it worth going. If anyone knows what they are good luck going and getting good table service.",2 years ago,1
Gondomar,restaurante,Sucesso dos Grelhados,Phillip Costa,"Sigh, I dislike writing ill of places but this was not great. My parents and I shared a plate of grilled steak which was to serve 3 of us but it was enough for maybe 1.5 of us. They also didn't ask how we wanted the meat, so while my father and I can eat it rare, my mother can't stomach that. She liked the meat jeu, so that's ok. My wife had the salmon and it was cooked well. No special sauce or anything, just a plain old salmon. It wasn't super expensive and in a month I will have forgotten it completely. And there is a chance that we just picked the wrong thing so take a chance and let me know if I did.",2 years ago,2

We all had the house Cod fish, with the house red wine.

Only thing special is the display of previously used presidential cars, some with openable doors. Ticket price of 3 euros per visitor is acceptable, anything above will not be worthy.",10 months ago,3
Gondomar,museu,Museum of Transport and Communication,Stephan Becker,"Not exactly sure what has happened here, but it seems that the more extensive collection that used to be on show in a different part of the building has been reduced to just a small exhibition of old presidential cars. So the museum's name is simply misleading at this point. The presidential car exhibition is not bad, though. And the renovation of the old building by architect Souto de Moura is also worthwhile to see. There is a small exhibition on the transformation into the museum on the second floor.",2 months ago,3
Gondomar,museu,Museum of Transport and Communication,Neil Kelly,"This was quite an interesting place to visit during my stay in Porto. The conversion of the warehouse into an events centre and museum was pretty cool, even keeping the old rail tracks along the floors, as well as the very industrial architectural style.
They had an exhibition of the old Presidential Cars on display when I was there, and it was very cool as a micro-display of the evolution of the car. The library which now showcases the old documents is very nice as well.
If you have an hour to use during the day while you're along the waterfront, this is a good place to visit. It is simple, and some of the rooms will be closed off for other events, but it's a neat piece of Porto's history to check in on.",5 years ago,4

You pay to visit with an audio guide and we didn't think it was worth it for us. Shame we came on a Tuesday, as it's free to visit on a Sunday and we would have looked around in that case.

Music events are held here.

Gondomar,museu,Casa do Infante,F W,"This is a hidden gem in  historical Porto which itself is a UNESCO world heritage site.

A restored historical house originally built in the 14th century as a customs house and mint.

Lots of exhibits, original structure still remaining.  Explanations are very detailed.  The most fascinating is a miniature model of the historical Porto region which will give the history (Portuguese, English, French, Spanish) of different spots when you pick them.

If you are, like me, a history (especially renaisssance), archaeological and architecture enthusiast, you will really enjoy this place.  I spent over an hour and half but it can be done as a quick tour.

Right outside the Caïs da Ribeira.  Perfect for a tour before or after a riverside lunch!  Also good for a rainy day outing.

Can only visit through a private tour (booked via airbnb). They don't often show up, so be sure to check. You can also email the host to inquire about additional opportunities.

This house is STUNNING. The outside literally stands in stark contrast to the treasur inside. The son of the original family spent decades and untold fortunes collecting the masses of porcelain, paintings, tapestries, furniture, and my favorite building out the walls, stairs, and ceilings.

Many large pieces from decommissioned churches include alters, doors, and a stunning pulpit at the top floor.

Gondomar,museu,Casa Museu Fernando de Castro,Oliver Hutchison,"One of a kind house museum dedicated to an exceptionally prolific collector of decorative arts. Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the former owner lined every surface of his house with materials and objects recovered from predominantly religious institutions - wood carvings, ironwork, paintings, sculptures, furniture, brocade curtains, gilt mirrors and so on, adapting the objects to fit the space available, which at times meant cutting off parts of canvases or trimming away some acanthus leaves to make a carving fit over a doorway. Walls, ceilings, floors, doors and windows are all encrusted with antique decorations including an ornate pulpit in the stairwell, a stained glass window as a skylight, a gilt gate from a church altar, and a domestic scaled hall of mirrors in the main sitting room. You'll enjoy this one regardless of whether you think it's ""tasteful"", so make the effort!

Gondomar,museu,Casa-Museu Marta Ortigão Sampaio,Dimitrije Dinic,"On January 14, 2024 (Sunday), we visited the museum. Please note that the museum is closed on Mondays. With the Porto Card, admission is complimentary.

Initially, the exterior of the building appears unremarkable. Even upon entering the first exhibit room, one might assume that the museum consists solely of a few paintings. However, this is not the case. There are two additional floors and a basement to explore.

Fortuitously, the museum guide was available and provided us with a comprehensive tour of the premises, offering detailed explanations of each exhibit. The house itself is quite unique, showcasing a distinct style on each floor. There is an impressive collection of furniture, which can be considered art in its own right. The furniture has been meticulously sourced from various locations, and the guide informed us that due to space constraints, some pieces are displayed in other public institutions.

The basement houses an exceptional collection of jewelry. I highly recommend visiting the museum, and if you are fortunate enough to receive a private tour from the guide, please consider showing your appreciation with a generous tip.",a year ago,5

Gondomar,museu,Porto Region Across the Ages,Melanie Mengüş,"We visited on a Sunday morning and it was almost empty. We had the museum for ourselves and enjoyed it a lot. The museum is an educational visit where you will learn about Porto and Portugal across the ages. We start our visit in the prehistoric period and follow the chronological order in the history. Each rooms are well themed so it makes it more enjoyable. We learned many things that we didn’t know before.

However, if you don’t speak Portuguese or English… this is not the place for you. They don’t offer options in other languages which is a shame.

But if you do speak either of these languages and are interested in history so it is the right place for you.",2 months ago,4
Gondomar,museu,Porto Region Across the Ages,Phil Bradford,"As an individual museum, this is expensive by any standards, but especially in Portuguese terms (€20). As part of one of the World of Wine (WOW) ticket packages, it becomes more affordable, and it is an excellent place for anyone interested in the history of Porto and how that fits into wider Portuguese history to spend a couple of hours. It is informative and uses a variety of media to tell the story, although some may find the section on the Middle Ages a little hard going (it is nearly all reading text, which I like but isn’t everyone’s preferred style). There are plenty of videos and audiovisual displays about some of the key moments in Porto’s history, and a few interactive displays to learn more. Probably too costly for anyone to visit casually, but worth it for anyone with a moderate amount of interest in a rich and fascinating story.",a year ago,4
Gondomar,museu,Porto Region Across the Ages,Rai H,"The three-star rating is due to the lack of acknowledgement of the pillage done to colonized countries. There were only boastful comments that showed one side of history rather than understand the harm that was done. In many other museums I've been to, panels on history are more objective, while this Porto museum sadly lack awareness.

€20 for a single visit is only slightly worth it if you don't mind reading many panels of text about the history. It's not for casual museum goers but can be enlightening and fun if you like to read. There is only a few interactive aspects and even fewer artifacts, making this a poor spot for children to learn. Despite the pricey ticket, I still enjoyed the tour, especially the documentary and some of the more colourful and dramatic personal history in the reigning families. It was only at the section on the history of The Age of Discovery that I was dismayed at the museum's lack of reflection, otherwise it was a good learning experience.",a year ago,3

The exhibition is new and very detailed and structured. You have to read very much to understand the story. Sometimes there are videos and other things to learn about Portugal.

You have an option to visit the entire area or just the exhibition area and I opted for both and it was well worth every penny. They have different seasonal exhibitions (per April 2024 I believe they have Yayoi Kusama BTW!) and also permanent exhibition.

One of the highlights of the museum is the Art Deco house and the huge garden area. Visiting the entire place is quite an exercise so prepare yourself and stay hydrated during hot days. Though they also have a cute cafe near the garden area which serves inexpensive drinks and snacks.

My biggest (and probably only problem) with the room was the bad thermo isolation, which made the room quite chilly (early December). An electric radiator style heater was available in the room, and setting it to max was barely enough to keep it lukewarm.

Gondomar,hotel,Residencial Monte Carlo,João Santos,"The first time we stayed here was pretty enjoyable. The bed was large and comfortable, the room was spacious and nice.

We really liked the prices and the room itself so we decided to return about a year later. This time the room was the worst ever. It was a interior room so, no windows or natural light at all. Most of the lights didn't work - same with the hair dryer. There was moisture and musty smell all over the room. The bathroom had a lot of moisture marks. We woke up every morning to wet clothes because of the severe humidity. Never again!",6 years ago,1

Is cheap but not that much to justify a broken mirror in the toilet or absence of warming engine.. We faced quite cold days and we didnt have even heavy clothes. In the hotel we suffered the cold unfortunately. The distance from the center is acceptable, near the metro station and bus stop. The hotel has no parking places so you'll have to park on the road and pay.",6 years ago,3

Desde a limpeza, alimentação, e simpatia tudo abaixo de zero.
Nao recomendo de todo, praticamente ao fazer as 12h a funcionária começou a ligar imensas vezes pra sairmos da suite.
Tanta pressa para nos tirarem da suite e depois fazem nos esperar 20 minutos no check out.
Sendo que logo a entrada andamos a trocar de suites por falta de limpeza.

Gondomar,hotel,TwentyOne Motel,Alex Pereira,"Atitude lamentável dos colaboradores.
Duas visitas recentes.
Numa delas o quarto estava sujo (cinza de cigarro por todo o quarto, loiça de pequeno-almoço da estadia anterior no quarto, preservativo usado no chão da casa de banho, base do duche muito suja, etc etc...)
Na outra visita esqueceram-se do pequeno-almoço e quando questionamos o atraso a pessoa ainda foi arrogante e manteve uma atitude deplorável.
Foi salientado ainda que tinha sido feita uma reclamação sobre o assunto da falta de limpeza do quarto (reclamação essa que foi feita por sugestão da funcionária) e foi dito que ""se não recebeu resposta é porque não vai receber"".

The food and drinks on offer are great, the rooms are amazing, and there's a really nice vibe to the pool/bar/outside seating in the grounds. It's such a peaceful little spot to be in.

Whilst it's a bit out of town, if you just want a nice spot to hang out in and enjoy having a great place to be, Villarit Porto is perfect.

Gondomar,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Joanna,"Despite the low price, the hotel didn’t meet my expectations. The rooms were dirty, there was mold in the bathroom, and the mattresses were very hard and uncomfortable. The only plus was the heater in the room. The door was hard to open because the lock was broken. There was also a guest next to me who kept smoking all the time. The only real positive was the friendly and helpful staff",6 months ago,2
Gondomar,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Atia Batool,"Generally it was a good enough place. The only disadvantage is that it’s quite far from the city. The room was clean, however the blankets did not appear as clean, so we didn’t use them. The reception staff was always available, and generally quite nice to talk to. The room was simple, but adequate. Shower worked well, and the room was also provided with a fan, which helped quite a lot with the heat. Overall for the price, it is quite alright, and I would recommend it to people , who like my friend and I are more focused at exploring the city, and just need a place to relax later on.",a year ago,3
Gondomar,hotel,Hotel Areosa,M D,"The  only good thing about this hotel is the shower.  The location is far out and the bathroom starts to stink because of the drains.

We weren’t told that we needed to leave our key to reception to get our room cleaned. They don’t change the sheets at all only the towels. The breakfast is so basic- bread rolls, cheese and ham. Based on my review I wouldn’t stay here again.",5 years ago,1
Gondomar,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Jennifer Sloyan,"The hotel is quite far out from Porto city centre and you need to take a bus then a metro to get there. The buses are very infrequent and you could be waiting an hour for one. The local area is very basic and apart from the metro doesn't have much going for it. There are very few places to eat and barely any pavements so you cant even walk too far in case you get ran over. It is very basic in terms of its facilities as the towels are on the small side and they do not provide toiletries apart from soap, which does smell quite nice. They don't provide you with a hairdryer either which I feel is a must in a hotel. The room is on the small side and we had to put our suitcases in the wardrobe to make space to actually walk around the room. The bathroom was quite nice and the shower was good but it had a tendency to flood the floor so we had to put towels down on the floor each time we had a shower. However, the drains appeared to be causing a bad smell to emanate from the bathroom as some days the odour was unbearable.  There were only two hangers in the wardrobe, the staff did manage to find a few more for us which was nice but there are no drawers to put your clothes in so you are basically living out of your case while you're here. The breakfast is extremely basic containing of 2 options of sugary cereal, bread rolls, ham, cheese and jam. We bought our own cereal to eat downstairs which staff had no issue with and we found the bread rolls were very nice but more of a selection would have been nice. It was very noisy and you could hear everything going on outside in the hallway and in the adjoining rooms. Also the key can be tricky to use and on the first day we had to get staff to open the door and this seemed to be an issue for other guests as they were quite loud and taking a long time to open their doors. They only have one key for each room so if you want your room cleaned you need to leave your key at reception. I wouldn't stay here again due to the location and poor facilities.",5 years ago,1

The value for money is great : clean, with a very simple breakfast (croissants, bread, butter, jam, yogurt, fruit, milk/coffee) but filling, and the staff are very attentive (they speak English for those who don’t speak Portuguese).

The hotel’s decor is a bit dated, but when you pay so little for a hotel in such a great location, you have to make some compromises. The most important thing is that it’s clean—which it was during our stay.",a week ago,5
Gondomar,hotel,Hotel Girassol,Michael George,"Pros:
- super good location and you can walk to many places
- rooms aren’t too small
- cleaning people did a great job cleaning the rooms and always stocked rooms with many towels

Cons:
- shower tub had an issue with draining and would back up. I told them about it and they said they fixed it but water would still back up
- water temperature for shower would change randomly
- hair dryer wasn’t working
- WiFi wasn’t working

Neutral:
- there are steps to go inside the hotel. It might be hard for people who can’t carry heavy luggage or walk up too many stairs
- a marathon happened in the area and roads were closed off to cars. If you care about that, look into it before you book

While there were many pros, the water not draining grossed me out a lot and the lack of WiFi made me burn through my limited data. Also, the shower water changing temperature randomly and on its own was very upsetting, especially during winter.",3 months ago,2

During our stay, my sisters and I were having some takeout when this person knocked on our door and informed us that a guest had complained about the noise. (I do recognize we were laughing a bit loud, but we didn't even have any music playing or TV on.  I understood his concern for the guest, so I apologized, but he starting to speak over me, stating and repeaing that he would call the police to the point that I felt  like a threat.

Absolutely vile and we've never experienced such a situation. The smell seems to come from inside the drains. The shower cubicle was extremely small, damaged and surrounded with this dirty curtain that we couldn't have a proper shower without it getting stuck on our skin.

The shower head it self blocked out and the water cuts and get cold during use. The other appliances like, toilet and bidet right beside each other at the corner of this tiny space with a sink blocking it from being properly used. Stinking! Absolutely unreal. They also don't provide shower gel or shampoo and the toilet roll disintegrates in your hand.

The bedroom was at the attic, and very, very tiny - and there are only a very small window at the very top corner of it to ventilate and no natural light. The pillows are terrible. Completely threadbare and just one per person.

The location is great and the price also. Wifi also wouldn't connect. There are only one socket/plug in the room. Also beware of extra fees upon arrival at check in.

Gondomar,hotel,City Heart Rooms,Jelena Stojković,"This is a big flat with rooms to rent. Check-in functions online and there is a key safe at the front door (you get a code from Felipe). The furniture is OK, has seen better days but it's not broken or uncomfortable, the flat is yeah old but well organised and the heavy front door seems safe. We took the room with a separate bathroom, which also meant we got our own big fridge, which is awesome. There is a big TV which we haven't used. There are two laundry machines in the flat, one is in the kitchen, the other (wash&dry) in the common bathroom with a tub. The kitchen has everything you might need, and the stove+oven are new. A small balcony is a great place to have breakfast or morning coffe/tea because it is in the shade. The building is located on a small peaceful street, all I heard were seagulls all the time.
All in all,  a decent place for a quite cheap price.",2 years ago,4
Gondomar,hotel,City Heart Rooms,Gabriella Metrucci,"Bed bugs, incredibly horrible experience.This was the worse stay of my life, I booked for 3 days and after spending two nights with the whole body itching, despite I brought my own bed sheets and thinking that it was due to dust allergic reaction as the place was generally not very clean, on the last night I woke up at 4am discovering that the bed was full of BED BUGS. I had to take antistaminics due to an allergic reaction that also involved my breathing and my body is still full of bites and itchy after one week.
I left in the middle of the night disgusted and I reported this to the property owner that didn't seem to take the issue seriously, and he was also very rude calling me a lier until I sent him pictures. Bed bugs don't go away with a steamer, they are pests and a very serious hygiene and health issue, that I have reported to the relevant local authorities, hoping for further action.
Places like this should not accept guests until they completely solve the issue with pest control.
I just can recommend to stay away from this place.",2 years ago,1

Gondomar,hotel,Estúdios da Corujeira,K. A.,"Let's hope it's never burning here. Container for water hose in staircase is empty, tiny balconies are facing away from the street, no fire ladders, no access to the backside of the house from the street. So no chance to get rescued, you are basically trapped and fire department won't get you out as they can't see, nor hear, nor access you. A bit like those tiny, wrinkled London houses, just uncharming and without the extra rescue option via the roof. You'll hear the main road the whole night, whether you are a light sleeper or not. The floor in every apartment cracks loudly and I woke up several times being sure someone was walking in our room, but thankfully it was just the neighbours. Slept in many basic conditions around the world, but would never ever stay here again. Not for half the price, not if was payed for it. Simply don't need to stay in a place where I end up as fried chicken just because chances are minimal to leave in an emergency. Worse with family. Neighborhood is kind of dodgy, parking can be tough.

The receptionist of your hotel does not speak English: We have been able to communicate with hands and feet, but I expect at least a good command of English in a hotel. The lady from the reception was very eager to help and friendly, but also visibly overwhelmed with the situation. 2. lack of cleanliness in the rooms: The hotel, which is aging and in urgent need of renovation, has a hygiene problem. There was hair from previous guests in the shower, the floor was sticky, and it looked very dirty overall, even though a cleaner had been on duty. I was disgusted to shower here. 3. breakfast included: little choice of fresh food, a lot of shrink-wrapped discount goods. The quality should be reconsidered here.

The room even smelt of pizza, from the local restaurant!
The breakfast was cold and bland. The dining room seemed more of a prison instead of a hotel !

First of all, a note to mention that the staff was all incredibly helpful and pleasant. From the moment we checked in until we checked out everyone received us with a smile and seemed eager to please us.

The hotel and spa itself are good too. Modern, cozy and clean. We stayed in what I think is probably the smallest bungalow — it was fine, but not memorable.
The spa was clean and pleasant too. We didn’t use the outdoor jacuzzi due to rainy conditions which was a shame — perhaps next time.

We had a private double room with the private bathroom. The bed was very nice and clean. The room size was pretty ok, and what I like the most was the baggage rack. The bathroom does not have the ventilation and it you can smell a bit of damp there. You have AC there too and excellent outside shutters. What I did not like is the hostel sounds. The door and walls are not sound insulated so if anyone wants to laugh or have party, you will definitely hear it at night. It depends on how lucky you are during the stay.",6 months ago,4

Now, as for the bad - The bathrooms are pretty gross, the showers get hot but the shower heads are all busted, and there's essentially 1 toilet for the entire floor I was on (which has at least 16 beds). There is 1 outlet per bunk bed, which means you can't have the light on while charging any of your stuff. Also, I was mauled by mosquitos the entire first night. I must have killed about 20 of them throughout the night. And the cherry on top: bed bugs, which I am still itching from.

Fabio, the guy from reception, was very friendly and helpful, taking the time to show me around all the facilities. I was able to drop off my bags before the official check-in time.

However, the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The kitchen is *extremely* small—only one person can fit at a time—and when someone is cooking, the entire living room fills with the smell of food. The common bathroom was smelly and didn’t seem to be cleaned regularly enough. The back garden is a highlight, though—a peaceful spot with plenty of trees, including fruit trees.

One major disappointment was that the pictures in the advertisement don’t fully match the reality, especially the common spaces.

WiFi connection was great, but there’s no connection in the garden. The whole place feels old and in need of a good refurbish.

When we reached the place, there was a kid running around, barefoot, and lots of noise (even though it was our first impression, we still gave it a chance).
When we reached our room, after doing the check-in, we examined everything, and took photos of what was wrong (we do it everywhere we go, since it is a way for us to be safe).
To begin with, the room, besides the floor, wasn't clean, there were some dirty spots on the cover of our duvet, and the duvet itself was brown and dirty.
There was a pole, but no hangers, below that same pole, there was a really really dirty quilt, with many brown spots and dirty. There was also a bug squashed and dragged across the wall, and in the top corner a dirty rigid plastic cover on the ceiling.
There was a window, with a curtain that lets the light enter, even at night.
The bathroom smelled like humidity and mold. The toilet cover was broken, and we couldn't sit on the toilet itself, since there is a wall right in front of the toilet, which makes it impossible to fit our legs there.
The shower smelled really bad once again, from humidity or so, and there was a really dirty place/rotten, for placing the shower gel, shampoo etc.
The shower ventilator was supposed to be yellow, it was black from how dirty it was.
At night we could barely sleep, there was lots of noise, from people in phone calls, kids screaming and people going up and down the stairs.
We had 1 towel for each one of us for the 3 days we were there. The towels weren't changed, neither the bed  sheets. If we wanted to change the towel, we had to pay 2€ each for an extra towel.

As we got accomodate with the room, we noticed visible lack of cleaning in the room (old furniture, dust in the Windows and floor, body hair in the bathroom, etc). Also, the rooms are so close to each other that we can literally hear every conversation from the other hosts. The cleaning ladies also started with cleanings at 8am during the weekend, not allowing us to sleep because of the noise (again, poor sound isolation And very close rooms).

The co-working space itself was fantastic—comfortable, well-equipped, and perfect for deep focus. Reliable WiFi, ergonomic chairs, and plenty of natural light made it an ideal work environment. But what truly made the experience special was the sense of community. Majo went above and beyond to create a welcoming and connected atmosphere. She organized a wonderful community dinner, which was a perfect way to meet and bond with others.

The entire setup was seamless—from the cozy accommodation to the well-thought-out communal spaces. Whether working, sharing meals, or just enjoying downtime with like-minded people, every moment felt effortless and enjoyable.

Por 60 euros nos hemos alojado en sitios encantadores. Al final reservamos uno en el centro por un poco más y lo agradecimos. El metro lo usamos una vez y a parte de caro 2.10 euros vimos que lo suyo es estar en el centro.",8 months ago,1
Gondomar,hotel,AL Pitões,Laura,"Para pasar una noche no está mal, pero una noche y no más. Relación calidad-precio: es caro para lo que es y donde está. Si esto te pilla a 5-10min andando del centro bien pero para lo lejos que está es caro. El aparcamiento está fatal en la zona, nosotros estuvimos un fin de semana y no tuvimos que pagar pero toda la zona es de pago y un máximo de 2h. Hay muchísimo tráfico en la zona, está ubicado en un cruce super ruidoso.
Del centro está relativamente cerca, 25min andando aprox. El timbre de la puerta no funciona y cuando llamamos al número de teléfono para que nos abriera la puerta, la persona encargada de recibirnos no hablaba ni español, ni inglés ni francés, solo portugués (al contrario de lo que pone en Booking).
Respecto a las habitaciones no estaban del todo mal. No hay A/C, solo un ventilador (menos mal) y el colchón los hay mejores. Teníamos baño privado, todo nuevo y limpio. Las toallas no las pudimos usar.",7 months ago,2

Gondomar,hotel,Canvas Atelier Hostel,Murat Yıldız,"There is no such a Customer Services and if you are lucky to reach out them after spending some hours for calling their phone or sending messages, you could easily see they are too far from providing such a service. Furthermore, if you share these realities to them, they may also cancel your booking just before check-in time to give you a trouble. I think they find it easier than answering their phone or replying messages after reservations. But thanks to them, we found a much better place with the same price :)",2 months ago,1

Gondomar,hotel,Canvas Atelier Hostel,Susan Andersson,"The electrical plugs are fallings apart, you will hear people screaming through the walls/on the street. In the dorm, you’ll share the bathroom with another room, so you have to lock 2 locks, the bathroom is shared by 10 people. The internet barely works, the shower is broken and dirty. It is not possible to pay by card, only by cash, so you will have to take out money, which might give you an extra cost. The extra cost for me was 10 euro, which is an extra expense you have to be ready to pay. If anything should happen during your stay, don’t expect any help - the staff and management are very unprofessional and rude, and they have poor english skills. Would not recommend. If you consider, choose another place.",5 months ago,1

The owner is such a sweet and kind lady that will always give you attention if anything is needed and the staff are all amazing as well.

The neighborhood is perfect too, away from the tourist center to make you feel like a local but still close enough to get all of your site seeing in.

Gondomar,hotel,Hostel Brazuca,C Leshne,"Booked this room because it was convenient to the station.  Then I saw that another very recent review on Booking said they experienced bedbugs.  I looked under the sheet and found black specs, crusty stuff, stains and rips on the unwashed mattress cover.  On the mattress likewise there were dark specs.  I photographed what I saw, put everything back the way I found it, left and asked for a refund.  I am not going to risk bedbugs. There was an upholstered table for luggage that I wanted to keep my things very far away from.  The hostel's response was to deny that what in the photo I sent were bedbugs, no addressing whatsoever what all the stuff on the mattress  and mattress cover was, and to deny a refund.  They first insisted I could stay in that room, then after realizing that another room was empty, offered another room.  They obviously have some experience with bedbugs, however they should know that another room in an infested building is not the answer.  A decent operator would refund the fee when someone brings filth to their attention and does not stay.  They seem somewhat desperate to collect every penny, but that is not a way to run any business.  Stay away.",2 weeks ago,1

It's a great spot for children .Noisy sound from speed boats and jet skies no control what so ever!!. There are plenty of tables but not enough shade. Once again the people ignore all the rules set out at the spot as there are signs indicating that dogs are not allowed and you can't make noise I saw dogs and crowds of people with their music playing loudly!!! When you leave this spot there are cars parked all over in place that shouldn't even be allowed as it makes the road so narrow and difficult to go passed and make your way through you will be lucky  if you don't damage your car!!!This beach would never deserve a five star rating because of what i have described above!!

The water on the beach warms up well during the day, so this beach is great for families with children.

If you really want to hop in the water you can only dip yourself in it after finding a spot away from dangerous rocks. I did that and it was doable. You can buy wind-screens with chairs for the price of €10,- ....is ok. There are also quite some beach bars. It was quite easy to get there bc of good connection with the main station of Porto, the way back is more complicated though. Overall I would return.",2 years ago,4

Gondomar,praia,Praia de Bocamar,Aaron Wileman,"Nice wild beach with a rugged beauty and a nearby restaurant. It can be a beach that can be quite dangerous, but it is patrolled by a lifesaver, although his true attention to life saving is questionable. In our visit, it was rough and very dangerous with a strong riptide running right from the middle of the beach (check the photo), which was exactly where he had placed the safety flags for swimming. Additionally, he had moved his own station further up the beach and was playing cards with some friends, paying no attention to the young children at the waters edge, between his dangerously placed flags. Be careful at this beach and I would recommend only swimming when it is truly calm and safe.",4 years ago,3

Maia,restaurante,Restaurante O Industrial,Kristopher Miller,"This was my 4th time to this restaurant.  They target tourists.  I noticed this time the Portuguese people didn't get ""couvert"" food set on their table.  Hit our bill for €22 for items we didn't order.  This time the waiter stated he had a ""special"" steak for us.  It was €84 for a fatty, grissely steak.  I should have asked the price but because it was my 4th time and I had seen most items on the menu were under €45 so I didn't bother.  I learned the hard way what others had mentioned to me.  Some restaurants are nice to locals but will also (this one) gouge the tourists.  Won't go back.  Won't be back.  Lost a local customer.

It could have been made with fresh seafood - there's a wonderful fish shop nearby with fresh seafood from Vila da Conde. It wasn't from there.

And he still put the new wine bottle on my table even I said I only need 1 glass of wine. but he keeps told me you drink 1 glass, you only pay for 1 glass.
I did not get this point. Customer needs to know how much is it before order first. and i don’t understand why he put the bottle on my table . that’s the thing I felt uncomfortable.
also, he put the starter and bread around 3kinds of foodon my table after I ordered.
I thought the price is included in the main dish. but when I got the receipt, the bread, starter, main dish were all separated. then the owner said if I did not eat, I don’t need to pay.

You have a bunch of different types of starters like you can see in the picture with the highlight being the amazing prosciutto that is cut in the house, you can see the full prosciutto pieces hanging on the ceiling when you enter. Big generous portions for the starters and lots of variety

The two main dishes we picked were the Vitela with rice and potatoes and the bacalhau à braga, which is essentially codfish with fries and onion. Both of them were great, they won't absolutely blow your mind but still great.

The deserts come with a variety of different typical portuguese pastries.

For drinks you can have beer, wine, sangria, soft drinks and water (might be missing some other option). You can drink as much as you want

Good staff, great atmosphere inside and it is designed for you to have a long dinner. This is not a place you go to have a quick meal. You will stay there at least 2 hours minimum, so keep that in mind.

We sampled his sorpatel, Goan prawn curry and tasty appetizers and a fragrant chicken biryani with perfectly cooked basmati rice. The warmth and hospitality from João at front of house and then Chef Owner Roberto himself bringing out a dish was outstanding. He explained his passion and love for Goan cuisine and linkage to his Goan heritage from childhood in Mozambique to his father’s restaurant in Lisbon.  On complimenting him on his perfectly piquant sorpatel he humbly mentioned it was his grandmother’s recipe. You can’t get more homely than that.

Maia,restaurante,La Costa Brava,José Silva,Enjoyed trying out this restaurant it quite close to the city center. This restaurant does not have a parking bay therefore one will have to look for parking elsewhere.If you are lucky to find parking 70mts away or you just have to park further.this restaurant doesn't accept reservations which is quite understandable considering the amount of customers that they have. If it a Sunday I suggest you come as early as possible as from midday on it starts getting crowded. The food is divine plates come with a lot of food! The staff are helpful and very friendly but they don't have to much time for their customers maybe if the restaurant employed  one or two more waiters it would be perfect!

Pros
1. Parking and entrance accessible for wheelchairs.
2. Free parking nearby.
3. Friendly and nice staff.
4. Free wifi.
5. Indoor and outdoor seating.

We paid 24 euros for 2 bacalhau, 2 soft drinks, and 1 sopa.
8. Payment in cash or multibanco.

Cons
1. Outdoor seating was still too cold. The heater did not work to heat the entire tent.
I advise you to arrive earlier to get indoor seating in the winter.

I had the opportunity to have lunch in this amazing restaurant: O Fernando near Porto Airport.
It is the first time I try this restaurant and it is a really good surprise.

The place is neat, very well arranged yet without the “Upscale” atmosphere that we may find in some restaurants.
This is really interesting.

The food is exceptional, also quite simple, but evidently crafted by someone who masters his Art.

That gives outstanding dishes, balanced, nutritive and satisfying.
It is also beautiful to see the plate arrangement.

I will definitely come back to try more dishes and the desserts that I missed this time.

Congratulations to the Chef and his/her Team.

Thank you so much for receiving me and serve such an outstanding meal.

Regards

Maia,restaurante,Rio Steak House,feistyfawn,"- Overall Experience: 5/5 stars - A second visit confirmed the excellent quality and value of this Brazilian steakhouse. The all-you-can-eat format is expertly executed, making it worth a return visit.
- Food Quality - High-quality meat served continuously at your table. While some cuts have inedible fat (typical for Brazilian cuts), this doesn't impact the overall experience. The fries are excellent, and they're generous with portions, even providing double servings of sides.
- Ambiance & Service - The restaurant setting is impressive, complemented by professional, helpful, and friendly staff who maintain attentive service throughout the meal.
Value for Money - At €20 for steak plus a couple of beers, it offers exceptional value compared to nearby alternatives like hotel restaurants. The quality and quantity significantly exceed what you'd get from a standard hotel burger at a similar price point.
- Booking Tip - While they accommodated a late walk-in, the menu was limited to steak options. Making a reservation is recommended to access the full menu selection and ensure the complete dining experience.

We had the house steak (don't pin me on the exact name) and a piece of picanha steak.

They come to the table with the meat on the skewer and cut it at the table. Like in Argentinië BBQ.
As a side dish we had rice with beans, really delicious, and some french fries finally correctly prepared (sorry, don't mean to be insulting, but outside of NL and BE having correctly prepared french fries is quite the challenge). To be fair I don't recall the salad, but it must have been there.

not even a iron and ironing-table at the room.
the iron brought from reception on request was not even working and more than 20 years old so i could not use it. to offer this to a customer, especially business customer before a meeting is not possible to put into words.

The room service was dreadful aswell, when the maids came to change our sheets and dirty towels, they took the dirty ones and didn’t leave us any fresh ones.
We had to head down to the reception and ask for new towels ourselves, but even then, the given towels were dirty. The breakfast is good, but if you want to try every food, you have to go as early as you can, because they don’t refill the amount of food as often and also serve non-fresh fruits.

I don't know if there are cheaper options but I've always stayed there but I can't say I'm surprised at the price increase to be honest because it's worth it. Now I believe they have lockers under the beds as an option but I've never felt it necessary to be honest.

This hostel is a bad place to stay, facing a highway-like road with absolutely NO OCEAN VIEW, and they are absurdly disconnected from the neighbourhood they are inserted in.

Because of them our surrounding gardens have been constantly vandalised and destroyed because they neglect to inform their guests that their GPS coordinates cross through other people´s private property, while littering, breaking fences and overall breaking the peace.

Great location, incredible surfing vibe, and wonderful people with whom you can share the passion for surfing. Louis, thank you for all the help I received; I learned a lot from you and became a better surfer. It's clear that you run this hostel with a passion for people and surfing. An amazing place!

I was trying to find a hostel near Matosinhos to surf, not only is the hostel a beautiful and spacious loft conversion, but it is run by welcoming Luiz and his family who are there to give you all the best tips around, whether it’s surfing or the best food spots. It’s been a fantastic stay. 100% this is the best place to stay if you’re looking in the area, next time I’m in town I’ll make sure to stay here again!",3 months ago,5

Maia,hotel,Vikap Guest House,Learn Vietnamese,Extremely noisy with no sound proofing. I had to sleep on the upper bed and it creeks loudly and Shaked whenever I climb up or down. The other guest was very rude and aggressive young guy who purposely Shaked the bed to annoy me and let his phone rang at like 1am. This place is ok if you need a place to rest for the night. But long stay is highly not recommended,in the last week,1

Maia,hotel,Hotel Star inn Porto,sofia liu,"I paid to stay here but was reported for being too noisy and was restricted from moving around. But have you ever thought that this is because the hotel has poor sound insulation? I can even hear the sound of hair dryers in other rooms in my room, which also led to me being restricted from using hair dryers at night. But what if someone arrives in the early morning and uses a hair dryer? Will you continue to report it? If it is because of the loud noise and disturbing you, then I am deeply sorry, but it also caused a lot of trouble for me.

Maia,hotel,Hotel Star inn Porto,Sharon Jervis,"Pros amazing shower in room

Cons - not a hotel more like a hostel,
students everywhere hogging tables in bar by placing laptops cables phones everywhere no where to sit for paying guests

Room - poor for the money, no kettle, coffee etc, our room hairdryer didn't work.  Double bed was 2 singles pushed together, 1 bed creaked every time you turned over or got out waking the other up.

Taxi or Uber needed everywhere you go.

Breakfast - what total carnage - surrounded by students, who just hogged everything toaster don't think it's an easy task to get toast it's not! Poor selection of hot food really salami sausage and scrambled eggs, coffee machine well cappuccino is hot chocolate!!

Staff - lovely however students run a mock in their pyjamas oh and the noise level at midnight is unreal, it's a no smoking hotel but they all stand by open doors smoking so they may as well sit in the bar.

Fire stairs aren't labeled as such in fact they are marked private!!",6 months ago,2

Maia,hotel,SwissPorto Guest House,M C,"Not sure if this should be considered a guesthouse.

Fabio, the guy from reception, was very friendly and helpful, taking the time to show me around all the facilities. I was able to drop off my bags before the official check-in time.

However, the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The kitchen is *extremely* small—only one person can fit at a time—and when someone is cooking, the entire living room fills with the smell of food. The common bathroom was smelly and didn’t seem to be cleaned regularly enough. The back garden is a highlight, though—a peaceful spot with plenty of trees, including fruit trees.

One major disappointment was that the pictures in the advertisement don’t fully match the reality, especially the common spaces.

WiFi connection was great, but there’s no connection in the garden. The whole place feels old and in need of a good refurbish.

Horrible pillow, likely to cause neck pain.",6 months ago,2

Maia,hotel,SwissPorto Guest House,Bárbara Pereira,"We made a reservation for 17th of August untill 20th of august.
When we reached the place, there was a kid running around, barefoot, and lots of noise (even though it was our first impression, we still gave it a chance).
When we reached our room, after doing the check-in, we examined everything, and took photos of what was wrong (we do it everywhere we go, since it is a way for us to be safe).
To begin with, the room, besides the floor, wasn't clean, there were some dirty spots on the cover of our duvet, and the duvet itself was brown and dirty.
There was a pole, but no hangers, below that same pole, there was a really really dirty quilt, with many brown spots and dirty. There was also a bug squashed and dragged across the wall, and in the top corner a dirty rigid plastic cover on the ceiling.
There was a window, with a curtain that lets the light enter, even at night.
The bathroom smelled like humidity and mold. The toilet cover was broken, and we couldn't sit on the toilet itself, since there is a wall right in front of the toilet, which makes it impossible to fit our legs there.
The shower smelled really bad once again, from humidity or so, and there was a really dirty place/rotten, for placing the shower gel, shampoo etc.
The shower ventilator was supposed to be yellow, it was black from how dirty it was.
At night we could barely sleep, there was lots of noise, from people in phone calls, kids screaming and people going up and down the stairs.
We had 1 towel for each one of us for the 3 days we were there. The towels weren't changed, neither the bed  sheets. If we wanted to change the towel, we had to pay 2€ each for an extra towel.
We don't feel like the conditions we were in were human, sanitary, or even safe.",7 months ago,1
Maia,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Joanna,"Despite the low price, the hotel didn’t meet my expectations.

Maia,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Atia Batool,"Generally it was a good enough place. The only disadvantage is that it’s quite far from the city.

The room was simple, but adequate. Shower worked well, and the room was also provided with a fan, which helped quite a lot with the heat. Overall for the price, it is quite alright, and I would recommend it to people , who like my friend and I are more focused at exploring the city, and just need a place to relax later on.",a year ago,3
Maia,hotel,Hotel Areosa,M D,"The  only good thing about this hotel is the shower.  The location is far out and the bathroom starts to stink because of the drains.

Maia,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Jennifer Sloyan,"The hotel is quite far out from Porto city centre and you need to take a bus then a metro to get there. The buses are very infrequent and you could be waiting an hour for one. The local area is very basic and apart from the metro doesn't have much going for it. There are very few places to eat and barely any pavements so you cant even walk too far in case you get ran over. It is very basic in terms of its facilities as the towels are on the small side and they do not provide toiletries apart from soap, which does smell quite nice. They don't provide you with a hairdryer either which I feel is a must in a hotel. The room is on the small side and we had to put our suitcases in the wardrobe to make space to actually walk around the room. The bathroom was quite nice and the shower was good but it had a tendency to flood the floor so we had to put towels down on the floor each time we had a shower. However, the drains appeared to be causing a bad smell to emanate from the bathroom as some days the odour was unbearable.  There were only two hangers in the wardrobe, the staff did manage to find a few more for us which was nice but there are no drawers to put your clothes in so you are basically living out of your case while you're here. The breakfast is extremely basic containing of 2 options of sugary cereal, bread rolls, ham, cheese and jam. We bought our own cereal to eat downstairs which staff had no issue with and we found the bread rolls were very nice but more of a selection would have been nice. It was very noisy and you could hear everything going on outside in the hallway and in the adjoining rooms. Also the key can be tricky to use and on the first day we had to get staff to open the door and this seemed to be an issue for other guests as they were quite loud and taking a long time to open their doors. They only have one key for each room so if you want your room cleaned you need to leave your key at reception. I wouldn't stay here again due to the location and poor facilities.",5 years ago,1

The room service was dreadful aswell, when the maids came to change our sheets and dirty towels, they took the dirty ones and didn’t leave us any fresh ones.
We had to head down to the reception and ask for new towels ourselves, but even then, the given towels were dirty. The breakfast is good, but if you want to try every food, you have to go as early as you can, because they don’t refill the amount of food as often and also serve non-fresh fruits.

Every night around 2-4 am it was noisy and difficult to sleep. The hostel is 25-30 mins walking from the city center, neighbourhood is doubtful (Google doesn't allow me to use the actual name of the place next door), so the location doesn't feel 100% comfortable and safe.",11 months ago,1
Maia,hotel,Axis Porto Business & SPA Hotel,Valerie Brotherton,"The hotel is very far from the centre of the city. We didn’t want to stay in the city because we only intended to stay 1 night.  But there aren’t any restaurants or shops close to the hotel so unless you have a car or use transit your options for dining will be limited to the hotel restaurant.  We ate at the lounge one night and it was not good.  All they were able to offer us late at night was a ham and cheese sandwich with potato chips.  The potato chips were the best part of the meal.

There is a 5 EU charge to park in their lot but it is a very steep incline to get to the lot and difficult to maneuver so we parked our rental car on the street.  There is no problem with parking behind the hotel.

The room was clean and well maintained but it is very small.  The staff are friendly and try very hard but we found not too knowledgeable.  We asked about finding a hospital as my husband had to go to emergency and the gentleman told us it was only 4 blocks away.  It was over a mile away.  We walked over a mile to get to the emergency department where we spent 11 hours.  We had to book another night because we were too late to get to our next destination.

When we called the hotel to book for another night they said they only had 1 room left but they would not hold it with our credit card.  It is against company policy.  If the room was gone when we got there – too bad.

They cater to tour groups.  There were 2 tour groups and the breakfast room was very loud and crowded with the tour groups getting ready to leave.  Breakfast was uninspired.

This is not a 4* hotel but a basic 3*.  It is very isolated and we did not feel it was good value for the money.",4 months ago,3
Maia,hotel,Axis Porto Business & SPA Hotel,Gillian Donald,"Straightforward, comfortable business hotel. It was full of coach loads of tourists from various countries, but the noise levels were OK. We had a room at the back on the 2nd floor, which was in a  quiet neighbourhood. The bed was very comfortable with loads of pillows and the amenities were good, including a bidet and a decent hair dryer in the bathroom and a safe as well as coffee and tea making facilities. The shelf space around the wash hand basin was limited, but we managed and the shower was good.  The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. This was the best feature of the hotel. Reception, bar, and restaurant teams were all lovely. Our safe battery failed and the reception and maintenance guys went out of their way to resolve things quickly for us. The food was a decent, plentiful buffet at breakfast which was included, and dinner was good value.

Maia,hotel,Hotel Jaguar,Audrey Lord,"We chose this hotel for our last night in Portugal to be close to the airport. I don't think their ""free airport shuttle"" is very useful since it only operates 8am - 8pm! That means it's only good for outgoing flights from 11am or later so you have time to get through security, or flights arriving by 730pm or so since you'd need to get your luggage.
The rooms were well stocked and included a fruit plate, water, and cookies which was a nice surprise! The rooms were clean except for a gross stainless steel toothbrush cup in the bathroom - who is using that anyway?!? 🤢
Aside from that, all looked good. Oh, beware about taking anything - there's a price list in the bathroom: $400 for the TV, $25 for the slippery mats by the bedside, some amount for the scale. Nutso. Who's stealing bathroom scales??
The common areas were compact but we didn't hang out there anyway. Street noise made it hard for my husband to sleep. Oh, and if you open the window it's way different than the USA - like, it opens fully, no screen, no safety measures to keep people from falling out!

The staff went out of their way to be helpful with us, they were really good. The room was ok but to be honest we only needed somewhere to sleep on the night of the game.

Maia,hotel,安泰威乐旅馆,Marcio Cordeiro Cajão,"The hostel has the worst owners I have ever seen, they don't know anything about fair price. The shared room is more expensive than private. Kitchen is very small and some pans don't even have handle. I found bedbugs in my room, I told the owner about it and the answer was like ""It is your problem, clean the room yourself"". They rented me a bed in shared room and did't put anybody to clean the place, so the room was a mess because if you put three stranger in the same room, none of them will clean, of course!

This was my 2nd stay here (the last was in 2019) and I chose it again because I was happy before. They now also offer a free breakfast which, although basic, was a bonus at this price, so all good.

OK rant over!
We arrived and a staff member was working on a laptop by the till, they didn't even acknowledge us until another staff member passed and spoke.
The meals and service were both excellent, food was cooked without being over done, which is not easy for a large party, and the waiting staff were pleasant and well trained.

Maia,hotel,Casarao paraiso,Mister Steve,"I stopped here in April 2022 doing the Portuguese Camino. Firstly, finding the place is near impossible as there are no indications the building is a guest house. The only clue I saw was a Camino clam shell tile by the gate and after 20 mins of me pacing the street an old guy drove out of the drive and gesticulated that he would phone his daughter as she manages the accommodation. Secondly, when the lady arrived she was warm and welcoming and quick to point out that the outside ""needs a lick of paint"". Understatement of the year. However the massive disappointment of the outside is offset by a more homely feel inside, not surprising as some of the lady's family still live there. Regarding my room, it was cold (April), there was an electric heater available to bring in from the living room. My private shower didn't work, so I had to use the communal bathroom. The Wifi signal was non-existent. There were only 2 places to eat at night in walking distance and only the Italian was prepared to do me some Gluten Free food (which was superb). A full kitchen available at the accommodation if required. The other front facing rooms looked nice and had fantastic views of the sea. Would I stay here again?

The bad: As mentioned in other reviews, the twin rooms have a large glass wall between the room and the bathroom.  There are a few opaque stripes to add privacy but silhouettes are visible and when anyone uses the restroom in the middle of the night the light floods the room.

Maia,praia,Praia da Memória,Galina Cuznetov,"Praia da Memória is more than just a beach; it’s a place where history and nature meet in harmony. Located near Matosinhos, this beautiful stretch of coastline offers a tranquil escape from the city’s hustle while holding a key piece of Portuguese history.

The first thing you'll notice is the striking obelisk that stands proudly on the sand. This monument commemorates the landing of Pedro IV and the start of the Liberal Wars in 1832, making the beach not only a picturesque retreat but also a site of historical importance.

The beach itself is a peaceful haven, with soft golden sand and clean waters that are ideal for relaxing strolls or simply enjoying the ocean breeze. It's a great spot for families, couples, or solo travelers looking for some quiet time. The area is well-maintained, with plenty of space to spread out, even during busier times.

For surfers and water sports enthusiasts, the waves here are gentle, making it perfect for beginners. There are also a few charming local cafes nearby, where you can enjoy a coffee or a traditional Portuguese snack while soaking in the serene atmosphere.

Parking is relatively easy, and the beach is accessible for all ages, with nearby walking paths and plenty of shaded areas for picnics. It’s especially magical during sunset when the light reflects off the obelisk and the waves, creating an unforgettable view.

If you're in the Matosinhos or Porto area, Praia da Memória is well worth a visit. It’s not just a beach—it’s a peaceful retreat and a reminder of Portugal’s rich past. Highly recommended!",3 months ago,5

It is very beautiful! And when the tide is low you see beautiful rocks full of green.

Beautiful beach, not a place to sunbathed on my opinion 😃",5 years ago,4
Maia,praia,Praia do Cabo do Mundo,N Pascoa,"Nice and calm beach. There are a lot of rocks to explore during low tide and that create water puddles for children. That being said you have to be careful while diving.
It has all the infrastructures you need (body shower, feet shower, free drinking water, wc). From June to September you have at least 2 lifeguards so it is a good beach for families with children.
Parking lot gets full quickly but you can find spaces near the houses and then walk to the beach.
It also has a good restaurant and cafe (not at all pricey).
The water gets tested regularly (it is an oficial point for sample collection).
Take something to protect from the wind just in case (it is windy most days - every beach here is).",5 years ago,5

Matosinhos,restaurante,Restaurante O Xarroco,Sérgio De Sousa,"Summary: Prices are completly insane but the food is good.

We had squid on garlic and small fried sardines as starter. Both great options, again the price is insane. 14eur each, it is not normal.

Then we had salmon, bream and more sautéed squid with peppers and rice, all tasted great. It won't blow your mind, it tastes good as you would expect.

The side dishes come in a bit too much on the smaller side of sizing and are a bit more mid.

The prices should be half of what they are. Nothing justifies the pricing. I would skip this place.",5 months ago,4

I recently visited a beautiful place in Leça da Palmeira, and from the outside, it looks amazing! The starters, particularly the soup, were reasonably priced and of great quality, which set a positive tone for our meal.

However, the main course was a bit disappointing. We ordered the special of the day, a sole fillet, and it was unfortunately overcooked and dry. At €55.00, I expected a lot more. The waiter was sweet and tried to make up for it by offering free desserts, which was a nice gesture, but it still didn’t meet the expectations set by the restaurant’s upscale appearance.

On a positive note, the wine from the Dão region was fantastic and complemented the meal well. Overall, while the ambiance and starters were lovely, the main course experience left much to be desired.",6 months ago,2

We ordered clams, squid, golden fish and the seafood rice stew.  Everything was fresh and amazing, including the apps that they brought out, which were some small shrimps, chorizo, some sort of shellfish and bread.  The highlight was the fish though, it was well seasoned and well cooked.

That’s a bit too much for a dip and it was already used by customers before and gave us the feeling of a tourist trap. Half of the 39€ Bacalhau fish was tasting okay but the other half was extremely chewy, dry and impossible to eat. For the price we would have expected more.",a year ago,2

Had one of the best fish soup (fish chowder) since several years. Sardines, although frozen (sigh), were fried to perfection in clean oil.
If I've to be picky, the only thing that was not perfect was the octopus, nor cooked on a charcoal grill but on - probably - gas plate not cleaned enough that left a tiny bit of  bitter taste.

Clean, though small toilets inside, where a much bigger restaurant room is awaiting you. So don't judge the restaurant just from the exterior.

This restaurant is right next to where the fish is landed having been caught that day so you cannot get any fresher.

Matosinhos,restaurante,TOASTLE - Matosinhos,J L,"Edited following the response from business.

They serve sandwich meals. Got the pulled pork (cachaço desfiado) and braised short rib (this is the veal options others mentioned) and heura vegan sandwiches. The meat ones were ok, but not anything out of the ordinary. Our friends were very disappointed in the vegan option. The taste was not great and definitely not worth the wait. No doubt the food looked nowhere near as nice as in the pictures.

If you get a menu you will get potatoes as a side. You can add a sauce, but it will be extra. Other sides include onion rings. You also get a drink with your menu. You can have a soft drink like Nestea or a beer to drink.

The staff were sympathetic and friendly. They initially said the vegan option wasn't available, but then explained it would take a while to do (presumably because they don't have it to hand like the meat options as it's not as popular). When we said we were okay to wait they got to it and it came out all around the same time. They also gave us an extra meal by accident. We liked that of course, especially as we hadn't realised the bacon and cheese (quiejo & bacon) topping was at an additional charge.

We paid a total of €19,90 for 1 pulled pork sandwich and 1 Menu Porto, including the extra charge for the Batatas B&Q.

Seating outside available, which was ok in early September though you did need a least a little cardigan/jacket.

It was an ok experience. We were swayed by the amount of stars it had on Google, but felt very underwhelmed. Couldn't say they made any of us a fan on this occasion.

They say it's a fast food business but we waited 20mins for our 5 sandwiches and meals to be ready (there was one other table around during our whole time there so they weren't overwhelmed with orders). So, this isn't as fast as you'd expect from the big fast food outlets. Also, if the reason is because there were 2 vegan options within the orders, that's not an excuse. If you can't do the food in time, don't do it at all. It isn't something that would be missed to take it out as they didn't like the sandwich very much. Our friends had asked for their sides to come first as they were hungry, but this didn't happen. So, it's annoying, but mistakes happen. The main issue is that we didn't like the food overall enough to feel like it was worth coming and waiting for. We all regret not leaving and going elsewhere when they said they didn't have the vegan sandwiches.

Matosinhos,restaurante,TOASTLE - Matosinhos,Halisson Skalee,"The items look much bigger in the photos than they actually are.

The sauces shown in the photo seem to be part of the fries, but that’s misleading—they all come mixed together, making them difficult to eat. Overall, not what I expected.",in the last week,3
Matosinhos,restaurante,TOASTLE - Matosinhos,Bekhruz Boo,"I decided to visit Toastle because of its high rating, but unfortunately, it didn’t live up to the hype. It looks nice from the outside, but inside it’s just a typical fast-food joint.

We ordered the pulled pork burger, which was alright, but nothing special. The chicken wrap was quite dry and very small. The onion rings were frozen, and the potato wedges were bland. On the upside, the sauce that came with the wedges was good, and the staff was friendly.

Overall, nothing impressive, and I’m not sure I’d come back",7 months ago,3

Matosinhos,restaurante,A Cachorra,Cynthia Edmonds,"We had a wonderful lunch here with a very kind and friendly waitress who helped us learn a few Portuguese words for our meal.

My husband ordered his favorite franceshina with an egg, with a side of french fries for dipping. He also got a large Super Bock, because why not?!?

The franceshina is a layer of steak, ham, Portuguese sausage between two slices of bread, blanketed with cheese and topped with an egg, served in a zesty tomato beer sauce. This is a sandwich that must be eaten with a knife and fork.

I didn't think I'd like this sandwich that is local to Porto, but it's one of my favorites. The flavors all blend together and it's quite hearty, flavorful, and filling.

I ordered the soup of the day and the cachorrinho, a Portuguese sausage and cheese toasted in a small baguette. It was crunchy and flavorful and perfect with my soup on a cold day when we were dining alfresco. It was actually larger than I anticipated.

Matosinhos,restaurante,Vagas,Dr Anish HV,"📍 “Delicious Food, Amazing Service & Stunning Ocean Views in Porto 🌊🍷”

After arriving in Porto and checking into our hotel at Four Points by Sheraton, we decided to have a relaxing meal at Vagas, and it turned out to be one of our best dining experiences in Portugal!

Located right by Matosinhos Beach, this place offers stunning ocean views, fresh seafood, and top-notch service. The weather was chilly and windy, so we chose indoor seating, which was warm, cozy, and still had a great ocean view!

1. What We Ordered & Experience 🍽

✔ Chicken Pesto Fettuccine – Creamy, rich pesto sauce with perfectly cooked pasta.
✔ Cod Fish Salvatore – A must-try! Fresh, flaky cod with bold flavors—one of the best we had in Portugal!
✔ Red Sangria – Fruity, refreshing, and beautifully balanced.
✔ Quinta do Cume Douro Wine – We got to taste it before choosing—huge plus! Smooth, rich, and paired perfectly with our meal.

2. Service & Hospitality – A Perfect 10! 🌟

✔ A-Star Service! Our attendant was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel at home.
✔ Wine Tasting Before Ordering? Yes, Please! – They offered us free wine tastings before we selected our bottle—a fantastic touch!
✔ Fast, Attentive, & Professional – Despite the restaurant being a bit busy, the service was quick and smooth.

3. Pricing & Value for Money 💰

✔ Mid-Range Pricing – Not the cheapest, but absolutely worth it for the quality, service, and atmosphere.

4. Atmosphere & Ambience 🏡

✔ Stunning Ocean Views – Even from indoors, the beachfront location made the experience extra special.
✔ Cozy & Warm Indoors – The restaurant had a great balance of a relaxed yet upscale vibe.

5. Any Issues?

🚫 None! We were lucky—no wait time since the bad weather kept some people away.

6. What Makes Vagas Special? 💎

✔ Incredible Service & Hospitality – Friendly, engaging, and professional staff.
✔ Fantastic Wine & Tasting Experience – You don’t get free wine tastings before ordering everywhere!
✔ Oceanfront Location with a Cozy Vibe – Perfect for a romantic dinner or a casual meal after exploring Porto.

7.  Insider Tip! 🔥

📌 Try the Cod Fish Salvatore, Fetuucine Pasta & Red Sangria—absolute must-haves!
📌 For the best experience, go before sunset for breathtaking ocean views!

Even though the food was good I don't think I will ever go back here because of the service cause if they felt that they couldn't serve us or were closing down, they shouldn't have invited us in, in the first place and said that lunch time is over and the whole experience over-all was just 😞🙄😡",3 years ago,2

Na exposição permanente da casa, além da coleção de pintura, desenho e gravura, são encontrados utensílios e escritos científicos de Abel Salazar, assim como peças de mobiliário originais da casa.

A Casa-Museu restitui o ambiente familiar do patrono, mediante objetos pessoais e retratos, assim como testemunhos da atividade do pesquisador, pedagogo e divulgador de intervenções cívicas, através de cartas, manuscritos, provas tipográficas, jornais e revistas onde colaborou.

É também na casa que se encontra a biblioteca do médico e a biblioteca Alberto Saavedra, com um fundo documental especializado sobre a vida e obra de Abel Salazar.

No jardim, está o Pavilhão Calouste Gulbenkian, com uma programação regular de exposições com artistas contemporâneos.

Foram os amigos e admiradores de Abel Salazar que, após a sua morte, acharam que a maior homenagem que lhe podiam prestar era transformar a sua casa numa Fundação.

But on reaching the property I was unable to enter as I didn't have the entry code. The neighbours helped me to get in contact with him and it was sorted at the earliest. This was the only glitch with the stay. No other issues with the property. Clean room and bathroom with few extra amenities like TV, Nespresso pod, electric kettle, packs of biscuits, jam. There is an outdoor area and a common area. Mr Rocha is a gracious host and he gave good recommendations of nearby restaurants.
I had complete privacy and could enter and leave the property at my own will and time.
I had a good time here and it was worth the money.",5 months ago,5

Matosinhos,hotel,Eurostars Matosinhos,clairedolci,"Fantastic hotel, immaculately clean.

Good facilities (pool, sauna, steam room, sensory showers). Unfortunately the sauna wouldn't get very hot on the second day (65-70) assuming this was due to a fault.

Not too far from the metro, bus stations and tourist information who were very helpful.

Breakfast was excellent, well presented and a good variety for all diets. If I had to pick on one thing, it would be that there was no option of porridge but there was plenty to choose from.

Evening meal is by room service or in the lobby, the menu is limited to sandwiches, salads, charcuterie boards and pizza.... A bit carby for most but there are lots of restaurants in the immediate vicinity if this doesn't suit.

Pedro on front desk was efficient, and friendly with a good sense of humour and excellently fluent in English.

Taxi to the airport was very easily booked at the front desk and the driver Ronaldo was a pleasure to talk with.

I can't really fault this hotel and I'm not very easily pleased.

The local vicinity is not the prettiest, lots of concrete builds, but the coastline and beaches are beautiful and clean",5 months ago,5

Matosinhos,hotel,Eurostars Matosinhos,J L,"This hotel is near the beach.

It has a sauna, indoor pool and hammam. Attention- you will need a swimming cap to use the pool! You can buy one, but it's just a cloth cap and since you're unlikely to ever use it again, probably more expensive than it's worth. So, bring your own or borrow one if you can.

There's a bar in the lobby, but never saw anyone drinking there.

The receptionist team were nice. They let us leave out bags as we were early to check in and we went to chill out by the pool.

Our room on the first floor overlooked the road outside and didn't have a balcony. Our friends on the upper floors had balconies, but rooms overlooking the port. So, they could hear the trucks moving around and did get some of the fish smell coming in. Don't think they provided slippers. They did provide robes though.

It seems parking is available, but done by agreement with a private parking lot.

This hostel is a bad place to stay, facing a highway-like road with absolutely NO OCEAN VIEW, and they are absurdly disconnected from the neighbourhood they are inserted in. They do not care one bit for any of the houses around them, they do not keep the piece or care to have any kind of relationship with their surrounding neighbours, being the most arrogant, self-centered and entitled people to ever represent the beautiful city of Matosinhos.
Because of them our surrounding gardens have been constantly vandalised and destroyed because they neglect to inform their guests that their GPS coordinates cross through other people´s private property, while littering, breaking fences and overall breaking the peace.

Matosinhos,hotel,Urban Porto - Hotel Amadeos,Natie N,"Clean and comfortable hotel if you stay for affordable budget and included breakfast.

Great location from public aviability prospective, near is located metro stop, bus stop. Near the hotel is avialable Pingo Dolce supermarket, but within 10 min walk reachable Mercadona and Lidl. As well beach location is around 15 min walking distance.  Going to Mercado(market) takes ~20min.

Interior of the room meets 3 star level, so no need to expect super modern style. Comfortable bed and pillows.
Avilable fan and even bottle openner, so can enjoy the wine.

The breakfast was a good variety and choice if we compare with average 3 stars hotels in Portugal. Don't compare breakfast with other European countries, because still each country has own specific.
Quality of food is affordable ( different type of buns, several types of ham, cheese, vegetables(small choice),  fruits, baked egg, ham, sausage, beans, crossaint, pie.

It make look that room design is outdated with low quality decor, but no need to expect premium from middle segment for such price.

Cons: the room quality and the facilities are quite poor.

We stayed here exclusively due to the convenience of walking to Primavera Sound. At 84€ per night, it wasn’t exactly cheap.
It’s a hotel to be asleep in; the bed is comfortable and big. Good pillows. Clean bedding.
The breakfast was a good variety and choice. Quality is so so, but you can pick your way through - even as a vegan you’ll be well served.
The room’s dismal (poor quality materials, window doesn’t close, listen-through bathroom wall, view over parking lot, walls and ceiling in sore need of painting).
Outdated, low quality decor.

Matosinhos,hotel,Holiday Inn Express Porto - Exponor by IHG,vishwas patil,If you want to catch the flights for next journey. It’s a good option. Check room rates on their website it would better. Breakfast is good specifically the bread taste is really good. Rooms are bigger. I suggest take road side room for the good view. Backside the building is there.

Matosinhos,hotel,Holiday Inn Express Porto - Exponor by IHG,Michael Renfro,"This hotel and staff are great!

I did research before I went to Portugal and knew how far it was from downtown and it actually turned out to be a great choice.

The hotel is clean. The rooms are a bit small, but fit two very well. My 18 year old son and I were fine. The beds are comfortable. And the room was QUIET!! Thank you God!
AND... AND... The air-conditioning was amazing!!

Heard some terrible stories about noisy hotels and I am a light sleeper.

The breakfast was really good and staff worked hard to keep it stocked. It was much better than Holiday Inn Express in Lisbon.

Yes, there is a supermarket close. Literally about a four minute walk. It's called Pingo Doce, and they are really reasonable and nice.

Only downside was that Both this hotel and the one in Lisbon had no refrigerator. really could have used that.

Anyway, thank you guys for the wonderful time we had..",6 months ago,5

Matosinhos,hotel,Holiday Inn Express Porto - Exponor by IHG,Simone Velluti,"Ok so I stayed here one night on the 25th of June for an emergency since my flight out of Porto was cancelled. I decided to wait 2 months before writing this review since I was still hoping eventually I would be able to solve my problem with this hotel and I don't like writing negative reviews. However, after 2 months of discussions via email, phone and even sending a friend which lives in Porto over there to talk to management my patience is over. They doubled charged me on my one night stand, clearly a mistake of the front office since they told me my first credit card did not go thoguh and took a second one and charged me for 2 diffrent amounts (100 and 70 euro). They do not admit the mistake, have not been able to provide an invoice and now they told me I need to speak to some agency which just told me they do not even have a website to make reservations which means it's a b2b agency they use at the hotel. Anyhow, long story short the management of this hotel and specifically the front desk manager lady is a complete disaster so I hope you never have to deal with her or that you don't have any issue with payments or credit cards with them.",7 months ago,1

Breakfast is super simple and fresh, there are only rooms and reception.

The two issue: my room was as smelly as a dirty toilet when someone tried to use cigarette smoke to hide the smell. So even if I expected tiny tiny rooms in old classic Portugal house, and the room was tidy, the smell just made the visit unbearable.
The hotel is very noisy when there is rain and wind, the doors are not tight and move when the wind is blowing strongly.

For comparison my colleague had a room in this hotel that didn't smell, so you may be lucky too.

Otherwise for a price it is a nice place to stay, esp if you only sleep in the hotel.",a year ago,2

Anyways, I booked a surfing camp and had a lesson at 10am, so I needed to drop my luggage beforehand in the hostel. I asked a day before if there's a possibility of doing that, and the guy with whom I booked surfing said of course and no problem. Fast forward one day, I arrived at 9am to the door of the hostel, and nobody answers the doorbell. Nobody answers the phone. So we waited, and some tourists got out, so we entered. All staff was there, they just didn't want to open the door. They were almost surprised that we are there and we want to drop the bags. The interaction was quite impolite.
We stayed one night, and the next day we checked out, but my friend left a personal item at the hostel. But in the room they had like a lost&found box, so the next day she called them several times. They were cutting the connection, and after several tries they just turned off their phone. So after this situation, she gave them a bad review here on Google that says that they don't pick up the phone. As you can see, they answered the review calling her ""uneducated""? I'm not sure based on what, but I'm pretty sure that insulting people in the comments speaks more of the person who is insulting, rather than the one who's being insulted 😅 Cheers!",7 months ago,1

I did however put down my time of arrival and there was no reception on when I arrived at 9,so I could drop my bags in.

She then allowed me put my belongings in my locker whiles the room was being made up. The shared room are fab you have a light, a shelf and full curtains around for privacy and its clean an cosy 10/10 for bed. Very comfortable, the bag lockers fits everything. Even your suitcase. There is terrace, a reading room, a TV room, a big kitchen, shower rooms. Honestly couldn't fault this place at €20 a night. It is a 5 min walk to the town with lidl, McDonald's, tabbaco shops etc. 5 min walk to the beach. The beach however was the windiest beach I've even been in Europe. But for surfing it looks amazing.
Highly recommend this area for a few days.

We had a very small room, though. It was advertised as a superior on Booking, which was apparently a mistake. It was the smallest room I've ever stayed in. The shower also leaked quite badly.

The bed was comfy, though. But ya, I wouldn't have been able to stay there for more than 1 night.

I also prefer the more hands-off service. Portuguese people are super friendly, but when you're tired and just want to settle in, the last thing you want is a 20-minute conversation with the person checking you in.

That's why I prefer hotels... friendly but also at a distance.

The rooms are tastefully decorated, combining modern elements with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. The attention to detail is evident in every corner, from the stylish furnishings to the carefully selected artwork.

The location is perfect, especially for those interested in exploring the vibrant city of Matosinhos. It's conveniently situated near the harbor, offering picturesque views and easy access to the beach. Additionally, there are plenty of dining options, cafes, and shops within walking distance.

What truly sets this inn apart is the exceptional service provided by the staff. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with genuine warmth and hospitality. The employees at the inn and the accompanying restaurant were incredibly kind and attentive, making me feel right at home. They were always ready to assist and provide helpful recommendations.

Moreover, the daily breakfast served at the inn was a true highlight. The variety of delicious options, from freshly baked pastries to local specialties, made for a delightful start to each day. The staff took great care in ensuring that the breakfast was not only tasty but also beautifully presented.

Friendly staff (Paulo?), with clear instructions given during our stay. Lovely decorations. Clean and tidy bedroom, with air conditioner, which is a bonus. They provided clean towels. Though there was no kitchen/breakfast provided, there's a TV room. Excellent connection of wifi.

I wish they put the hotel name outside the building. we were unsure if we got to the right place before as there's no name on the door. For those who needs a peaceful sleep, bear in mind that the tram rail is just next to the building (a plus in terms of access to the transportation, nearby stop) and whenever someone is closing their doors in the building, it'll make sound. This shouldn't be the reason not to stay here, as you can always prepare ear plugs or ear phone.

My only complaint is about the personal bathroom provided to us. It was spacious, but has  strong mouldy smell when we first open the door. The ceiling is covered by mould, probably due to the high humidity. I am not sure if the ventilation works, so maybe putting humidifier/ fragrance would help.

Unfortunately sleeping was a total pain. All trough the night there would be guests from other rooms using the bathroom that was attached to the dorm where I was sleeping and when opening the bathroom light, it shined brightly into the dorm because of a large window, plus the bathroom had an an extremely loud fan. So several times at night there was an intense noise and bright light in the dorm. I found it absolutely horrible, and it could easily be changed.. would not recommend for sleeping",a year ago,3

I faced my claustrophobic demons all night long. We prepaid for two nights. Being distracted by The Law and Order channel was how I survived until sunrise (and sedating myself  with Super Bock). People are exaggerating the shaking when the metro passes by. It wasn't that bad. Eat at Thamel next to the beach, two blocks away. Off-site check was at the Del Rei (?) a stones throw north.

Matosinhos,hotel,room Select Porto Suites,Artemi Bendandi-Marketou,"The rooms are marked as having 3 stars on Google Maps and Booking, but upon arrival we saw on the building itself that the facility actually has 2 stars.
Long story short: if you are a light sleeper, don’t book here. Our room was on the 7th floor and the noise from the street was still too much. There is traffic during the night, as well, so it’s impossible to sleep with an open window. There were several noise sources in the room itself, including the fridge and ventilator. There is a very bright billboard on the other side of the street playing video ads, so to sleep you would need earplugs and a sleep mask.
Bathroom: there was no backup toilet paper, and no toilet brush, which we found baffling.  The bathroom ventilator didn’t work, and the bathroom has no window, so no other means of ventilation. On the first morning, there was a drain smell from the bathroom. I also spotted a couple insects.
Location: the location is good, close to the metro Trindade and to walkable distance to basically everywhere in the city center. The only issue is that the buildings nearby are dilapitated, but it’s Porto, so that is basically inescapable. There’s two good nightlife areas nearby.
Cleanliness: the rooms were clean and spacious.",6 months ago,2

Helpfull and friendly, answered all my questions and offered help and good advice! Wi-Fi was good for my purposes, easy access and always connected. Did not try the breafeast, but the bar/lounge area was nice and quiet. Some small things; I choose this hotell because of work and that I could walk.

Breakfast was good and coffees in the bar were very reasonably priced.
There is an underground car park. If you are driving anything larger than a skateboard you will find it rather tight. Our rental car - a medium sized Citroen C4 - required quite a few back and forth shunts to squeeze between the pillars at the end of each parking space, and the steep spiral slope to get in and out of the car park requires care. But it is secure and has a lift directly into the hotel.

There is an indoor pool, turkish steam sauna, jacuzzi and sauna. Right outside the pool area is enough space to soak up the sun on one of the chairs, a bar and a children playground.

Oliveira de Azeméis,hotel,Golden Tulip São João da Madeira,daezjn,"Nice looking hotel but lacked convenience and comfort. Air conditioning never worked although promised will be fixed. Every day spent with room window ajar. Had to sleep with window open to let the crisp air in (fortunately the nights were cool) from outside otherwise the room is just too uncomfortable to sleep- and I live in the tropics lol. Not recommended for light sleeper as sleeping with the window open means hearing the occasional rooster crow and dogs barking in the middle of the night and early morning. The afternoon sun literally bakes the hotel room in the day. Interestingly the lobby and lifts are always well air conditioned.

Dinner was a set menu with no alternative options and the food was mediocre- I would recommend to eat outside River Restaurant is just a short 10min walk and serves great Portuguese roast chicken- I’ve written a Google review about it :)

However, I would give three stars. One for the staff who are lovely ( the guys are all very attentive and responsive), and the second for amenities such as reliable fast wifi and rooms although show signs of wear are well maintained and clean. TV channel choices are abundant and room is well stocked- toilettries, bottled water, range of towels, bath robes, luggage stand, mini fridge with drinks, charging points, etc. Bed and pillows are comfortable.

Was here for a business trip with colleagues and noticed quite a few other business guests staying here too.

You can shower in the waterfall if your brave and the garden is inspiring and relaxing. Thers a BBQ pit for the summer and Nick cooked a meal for me and him to enjoy. He stocks up the fridge with beer and cola and wine for a Euro a pop. Think the meal was €5 and the bed €16 and that includes bedding with a duvet and a towel.

The rooms and showers were very nice and comfortable. The hot tub was a great experience after long days of hiking. There are a lot of additional facilities on the property - kitchen for common use, pool, hot tub, hammock etc.
All the property is in the key of sustainable ecology, which was very much to my liking.

It is in a quiet and peaceful location, with a beautiful garden with a swimming pool where you can sit and chat. It was cool in the evening on our visit, so we appreciated the option of sitting in the side building where it was warm. We had rooms with own bathroom which were decorated with a flair for beautiful design in every detail. Everything was spotlessly clean and fragrant. The bed was large and comfortable, the bathroom luxurious with a massage shower. We took advantage of the laundry service and got our laundry back dry the same evening and beautifully folded. We loved the breakfast, fresh bread, fruit, cheese, cold cuts, sweet pastries and more. The owners have been offering it since early in the morning, knowing that some pilgrims start very early. The owners are very sympathetic and friendly. Fantastic place, we highly recommend it!",11 months ago,5

Muito obrigado Rui, do fundo do coração! Por tudo e mais alguma coisa, por ser um profissional de 5 estrelas mas por ser uma pessoa íntegra, impecável, com uma personalidade mais do que acessível e de uma forma geral uma pessoa de infinitas estrelas, é das poucas pessoas que conhecemos e reconhecemos de imediato que é uma pessoa amiga e que gosta de ajudar!
Não há agradecimento, nem palavras suficientes para descrever o quão importante o Rui foi na concretização do nosso sonho!
Só nos resta de dizer, que apesar de sabermos que é o trabalho do Rui, após termos conhecido variadíssimos profissionais na área que foram ou bastante desagradáveis, ou uma enorme desilusão, o trabalho e a pessoa que o Rui demonstrou ser foi algo tão inesperado de uma forma positiva, que nos sentimos em dívida eterna para com ele, por isso é que podemos dizer também que no que depender de nós, seja o que o Rui precisar, não hesitaremos em fazer o que estiver ao nosso alcance para que o possamos ajudar!

Oliveira de Azeméis,hotel,VistaFreita,Monika F.,"Miałam przyjemność spędzić kilka dni w VistaFreita, i poznać włascicieli Macário i Anabelę, i mogę z całego serca polecić to miejsce każdemu, kto szuka komfortowego i przytulnego noclegu.

Pokoje pięknie urządzone, co sprawiło, że poczułam się jak w domu. Wnętrze było schludne, czyste i starannie wyposażone we wszystkie niezbędne udogodnienia. Kuchnia była doskonale zaopatrzona, co umożliwiło mi swobodne przygotowywanie posiłków.

Lokalizacja VistaFreita jest znakomita – blisko do lokalnych atrakcji, ale jednocześnie zapewnia spokój i ciszę, idealne do relaksu po dniu pełnym zwiedzania. Widoki z okien były po prostu oszałamiające i dostarczały niezapomnianych chwili.
Po sąsiedzku mały kościółek, który przypomina nam co kwadrans, która godzina. To było fantastyczne i w ogóle nie zaburzało ciszy, takie krótkie bicie dzwonów to folklor lokalny który dodaje niepowtarzalnego charakteru temu miejscu. Czułam się tam naprawdę dobrze, jakby czas zwolnił...

Pan Macário i pani Anabela to prawdziwe perełki w świecie gospodarzy. Ich gościnność, troska o szczegóły i chęć pomocy sprawiły, że mój pobyt był jeszcze bardziej przyjemny. Zawsze służyli radą i byli dostępni, by odpowiedzieć na moje pytania.

But this place - it was soo wonderful to stay with this family at their little paradise, we had to stay another night and take a rest from all the castles, forts and churches.
Most interesting for me was their own water mine - yes, water MINE.  They live almost on top of the mountain and about 100 feet uphill in their garden was a shaft about 20 feet deep from there the shaft went horizontal until it reached a stream of water.  Remember we are on top of the mountain this is no ground water.
The water was channeled towards the house and flows right under the kitchen floor, covered by some removable 4/12's. It then flows to several ponds. Simply amazing.
This place is also a paradise for children, plenty of animals, space for little adventures and wonderful Celine and her husband who knows everything about whatever you want to know. We learned a lot from both of them during our short stay.

Plug in sink did not seal and got stuck. Air conditioning did not work on cooling. Dogs barking outside kept me awake. Every morning I arrived at the restaurant for breakfast at exactly 07:00, each morning I watched them light some candles under the metal trays of bacon and egg. The food was stone cold. When I pointed out that I wanted hot breakfast they told me to wait for the candle to heat up the food!

I did eat meals at the restaurant and the food was ok, but not great; just about any local restaurant is better.

At Breakfast was fairly basic too. Staff unfriendly. Everything seems too much. A person ask for scrambled eggs and the waiter said will need to make them as previous ones were a bit green.

The massage was excellent, in a room that was nicely decorated and had a very comfy bed. The indoor pool had a slightly musty smell, but it wasn't too bad.

The food was a big highlight. Dinner was amazing, especially the starters, the fish dish (Robalo), and the desserts. Great presentation and taste. Breakfast was also excellent, with lots of choices and eggs made fresh to order. The river near the hotel looked shallow and clean, and there were some cozy spots to sit and relax by it.

Below some of the things that I loved and I'm sure I'm forgetting so much more:
1) the homemade dinner was always delicious, with big portions, I had dinner every day at moleiro da costa má. Soup, main dish, bread, wine and dessert for 10€!!!. Most of the products are from their farm (the potatoes are awesome).
2) the afternoon tea with some cookies or a cake.
3) the swimming pool of natural water was very refreshing and the seats around the pool are comfortable and it's possible to find shadow if needed
4) the aromatic bath was a gem that I wasn't expecting.
5) the sound of the river during the day and at night was very relaxing.
6) the hammocks near the river or under some trees were perfect to relax while reading a book
7) the sympathy of D. Natalia and her husband which were always nice and truthful. Always ready to help.
8) the recovered old house (were I stayed) was very nice and cosy but the apartments seem much more comfortable, they are also more modern and new.
9) the breakfast was good without much variety but it was enough, with always fresh bread and the delicious homemade blueberry jam.
A place to return which I truly recommend.

I loved the time at Moleiro da Costa Má and its difficult to find a place with better value for money, but there are some improvement opportunities:
1) the rooms are clean but its suggested to perform a deep cleaning, particularly in the corners and near the windows, we removed some dust from the furniture.
2) minor fixes should be addressed, e.g. the toilet seat was damaged, a leg of one of the sofas was broken.
3) the beds are comfortable but the mattress had some fuzzballs and the sheets had some minor spots.

If you are looking for an anonymous, hotel style atmosphere, you probably shouldn't come here.

But if you like a nice chat with the hosts, enjoy their home cooked dinners (something else every night, costs extra, but is not expensive), like a home far away from home, with a pool, a nice backyard, cosy rooms and a walk to the beach, that has several places to eat or drink, and LOTS of sand, dunes and waves, then you are at the right place.

We certainly had a good and very relaxed time. If we go on holidays in the area again, this is a sure stop.",7 months ago,5

The starters, which they bring whether you ask for them or not, are OK, but a lot of deep-fried things which are probably not home-made. Mains: the Cod came swimming in oil and caked in something like breadcrumbs (it was also huge, a portion for 2 was enough for three people). The taste was bland. We didn’t finish it. The octopus was cooked fine, not rubbery, but it was too salty and again, the dish had no real flavour or interest. Overall: fussy, try-hard service and boring, oily food. Oh and very expensive too! €65 and we only had food for three and one glass of wine, no desserts (we had given up by that point).",5 years ago,1

Paredes,restaurante,Temos Pena,Satoshi Miyashita,"Tamos Pena is a Portuguese home-cooked restaurant that we stumbled across on the way to the winery, and it became one of the most memorable restaurants on our trip.

The dishes I ordered this time were beef steak and traditional monkfish and seafood tomato stew.

The beef steak was purchased from the northern region of Portugal, and was a shocking red meat that cannot be eaten in Japan. Even though it was not aged, the lean meat overflowed with flavor and was cooked simply with salt, bringing out the original flavor of the beef.

Also, regarding the monkfish soup, it was made by mixing seafood (monkfish and shrimp) that had been extracted over a long period of time with tomato stock and rice that still had a texture to create a risotto-like result. I thought it was an umami bomb and an upper-class dish, but it was a great dish with a comforting home-like warmth.

I don't think many people visit this area, but please stop by when you visit wineries. Recommended.",5 months ago,5
Paredes,restaurante,Temos Pena,Emanuel Ribeiro,"Nos lugares mais escondidos encontramos pequenos tesouros e é bem verdade.
De fato escondido, mas com bons acessos, encontramos um restaurante que nos deixa em dúvida se estamos a entrar num restaurante ou quinta antiga. A entrada no estacionamento já cativa, mas depois no interior a atmosfera interior deixa qualquer um encantado. Os pequenos pormenores desde a decoração, ao aproveitamento das áreas, de uma antiga casa ou quinta, onde permite criar pequenas salas privadas para pequenos grupos ou maiores.
Das entradas para salientar a simplicidade, mas a qualidade dos sabores. Uma excelente tábua de presunto acompanhada por uma compota de abóbora com canela e um queijo amanteigado de chorar por mais.
O sortido de salgados também era de qualidade.
Para o prato provamos a Posta à Temos Pena, e só temos pena de estar tão boa, pois não tivemos espaço para degustar as sobremesas que estavam com óptimo aspecto.
De salientar que devem reservar, coisa que não tínhamos feito, mas prontamente no local fizeram de tudo para termos uma mesa e ainda bem que o fizeram senão teríamos perdido esta excelente refeição.
O atendimento foi do melhor, por parte de todas as pessoas que conhecemos, tenho pena de não ter tirado mais fotos, mas o deslumbre pelo espaço foi tanto que preferi contemplar em vez de fotografar.",8 months ago,5

Paredes,restaurante,Solar da Brita,Helder Miguel Ferreira,"Processo de Reserva: Fizemos reserva previa em que tivemos que escolher o prato desejado (escolha de pratos era limitada, com apenas duas opções: Cozido à Portuguesa ou Rojões), que me pareceu bastante interessante!

Comida: A entrada consistiu em uma pequena quantidade de presunto, quatro pataniscas e pão. O Cozido à Portuguesa estava delicioso e bem preparado, com bons produtos. Para sobremesa, serviram um delicioso pão de ló caseiro. O vinho da casa foi servido em um jarro pequeno (via bag in box), apenas suficiente para duas pessoas.

Serviço: O atendimento foi prestável, cordial e relativamente rápido.

Preço: O restaurante não apresenta uma ementa nem da comida nem dos vinhos. Não aceitam multibanco, sendo por isso obrigatório pagar em dinheiro. O processo de cobrança foi uma surpresa desagradável: apresentaram um pedaço de papel com o valor total de 75€ para duas pessoas, sem qualquer discriminação do valor de cada item que estavamos a pagar. Este valor foi muito exagerado para o que foi servido e acima de tudo sem entendimento de como se chegou a esse preço. No máximo, 55/60€ seria um preço justo. Por conveniencia não foi dada alguma explicação/descrição detalhada dos itens cobrados. Ao pedir a fatura, para alem de quase acharem estranho, a fatura veio com o descrito apenas como ""2 refeições: 75€"" com IVA de 13%. A falta de transparência é preocupante e parece que o custo pode variar conforme o cliente. Recomendo que as autoridades façam uma visita para normalizar este processo obscuro (falta de menus, pagamento em dinheiro, iva a 13%) e eventualmente subfaturação.",a month ago,3

Paredes,hotel,Penafiel Park Hotel & Spa,Karl S,"I recently stayed here and unfortunately, my experience was marred by several significant issues that raise serious concerns about the safety and standards of this establishment.

During our stay, we encountered a dangerous situation involving the high chairs in the restaurant. Despite the hotel's assurances, these chairs are clearly unsafe. When used by toddlers, they pose a risk of falling, which could lead to severe injury. It's unacceptable that the hotel suggests these chairs are ""safe if used safely."" Safety should be inherent, especially when it comes to young children, who cannot be expected to sit still or use a chair ""correctly"" at all times.

Moreover, the food safety practices at the hotel are equally troubling. We were served undercooked burgers at the bar, a serious health risk, particularly for children and vulnerable individuals. The hotel staff failed to ensure the food was cooked to the necessary safety standards, and their response to our concerns was dismissive, focusing on the wait time rather than addressing the real issue of undercooked food.

In addition to these concerns, our stay was further compromised by the lack of basic amenities and other safety issues. Despite requesting a cot/crib, none was provided, and we had to make do with a sofa bed. The children's playroom also posed safety hazards, with sharp corners, low exposed electrical outlets, and an exit leading to steep steps without proper separation—all of which are unacceptable risks for a four-star hotel.

Overall, the hotel's lack of attention to guest safety and well-being, as well as the dismissive attitude towards our concerns, is deeply disappointing. I strongly urge to reassess their safety standards and take immediate action to ensure the safety and comfort of all guests.",7 months ago,1

Paredes,hotel,Penafiel Park Hotel & Spa,Fábia Vasconcellos,"Unfortunately, I had an unpleasant stay at the hotel. Starting, the room, it is absolutely outdated, very dark with old furniture scratched. The wall with paper wall with the image of a labour female on it made me totally uncomfortable. Also some strange smells, like mildew. I asked to change, the staff kindly showed a another room that was terrible like the first. However, smelling better and with a nature painting on the wall, I had to wipe the dust. I tried to close the bathroom door but doesn't work. Also, the jamb mass falls.
As I was on a work trip, I will appreciate having an iron, but it was denied, and I had to use the laundry service.
I had my first-day dinner in the restaurant, I ordered a risotto, that was extremely salted. I thought it was like it was a joke because  I had not wanted the bottle of water. A hole in the floor behind my chair in the restaurant.
My laundry comes back,and to my surprise, the skirt was completely wet. I laughed, as I was tired to complain about everything. After four days, I came across the third Tour group, which have run out the goods for breakfast. Only one attendant, who looked totally lost...

Restaurant for evening buffet and lunch standard was excellent both in service and food range and quality, the fish was absolutely first rate. Spa massage treatments very good quality again and a really nice space including jacuzzi, indoor pool, steam and sauna and the outdoor pool was a good size and surrounded by a lovely mature, green backdrop...road noise not a problem for me.

Ich habe ein paar Tage nach der Buchung eine Email geschrieben um meine Situation zu erklären, dass ich heiraten werde und ich mich gerne dort in dieser Suite zusammen mit den Brautjungfern am morgen zurecht machen würde. Dafür würde die Stylistin am morgen in die Suite kommen um uns vier zu schminken und zu frisieren. Um ca. 11 Uhr würde noch der Fotograf dazustossen um noch ein paar Fotos in der Suite zu machen und danach würden wir vor dem Mittag das checkout machen und das Hotel wieder verlassen um in die Kirche zu gehen.
Auf meine Email haben sie mir nur geantwortet, dass dies nicht möglich ist dass die Stylistin und der Fotograf in die Suite kommen (ohne Begründung). Ich habe dann nach dem Grund gefragt und er hat gesagt, wegen den anderen Gästen und sie hätten an diesem Tag eine Braut die dort heiraten wird.
Ich war sehr enttäuscht weil ich habe extra eine Suite gebucht wegen dem Platz, habe sie vorgängig informiert und das Hotel wäre von der Lage her optimal gewesen. Die Suite war ja nicht besetzt und ich hatte schon gebucht, sie stand also noch zur Verfügung unabhängislg von der anderen Hochzeit. Ausserdem hätte ich weder das andere Brautpaar noch die anderen Gäste gestört, wüsste nicht wie.
Und warum darf man sich nicht dort in einer Suite die man bezahlt zurecht machen nur weil noch eine andere Braut im gleichen Hotel ist?
Ich verstehe es nicht! Nur weil ich nicht dort mein Hochzeitsfest feiere darf ich keine Suite buchen um mich zurecht zu machen? Und warum darf die Stylistin am morgen nicht dazustossen? Komisch!

Como hotel não é mau.
Recepcionista foi simpática no Check-in e no Check-out.
Ponto negativo: ( pequeno almoço fraco nos produtos e pouca variedade.
Pior foi ter que ir ter com a funcionária que estava responsável na sala do pequeno almoço, para devolver pão que estava na travessa para consumo dos hóspedes, completamente secos,quando deveria ter pão fresco.
A funcionária ficou sem saber o que dizer, apenas olhou e disse (desculpe ), e foi para a cozinha.
A meu ver isto não deveria acontecer.
Na minha opinião no que diz respeito ao pequeno almoço , não compreendo como este hotel é considerado 4 estrelas.
Só por isto não recomendo.

Paredes,hotel,Stone Farm Hostel,Lola Bretones,"We made a reservation for 7 families (12 adults, 9 children and 3 dogs) in May 2024, considering a stay of two nights in August. When we got there, we were greeted by a man who rudely asked us if we were taking a dog, to our surprise, we told him that there were three in total, but that the other two came with the rest of the families. He tells us that he does not allow dogs in the accommodation.
After an uncomfortable conversation, where this gentleman increasingly raised the tone of his voice to the point of having to ask him not to shout at us, we showed him, searching and reading the previous emails, that in the various emails that we exchanged beforehand to make the booking, he was told that 3 dogs would accompany us, as was confirmed. We never travelled without informing and confirming the admission of pets in the accommodation.
Despite this, he did not apologise or admit his mistake. He continued with his high and unpleasant tone of voice to tell us, almost sparing our lives, that we could stay the first night, insisting that if the dogs bothered his clients (it seems that he did consider us clients, even though we had made a reservation more than two and a half months before) we would have to leave.
We pointed out that we were accompanied by children and their ages, as indicated at the time of booking. He again insisted on the need to leave if children or dogs disturb his clients. Given this situation and treatment, we asked for our booking to be refunded and left. We had to look for accommodation for 21 people and 3 dogs in August at half past seven in the evening, we almost slept outdoors. I can't find adjectives to describe this person. We experienced a very unpleasant situation. On several websites it still indicates that ""pets allowed"". NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.",8 months ago,1

we arrived at 3:30 p.m., he did not want to open the door for us, explaining that check-ins are only allowed from 4:00 p.m.... he could have at least let us into the outside area without giving us the room... so we waited 1/2 hour in front of the gate while it was standing still.
Everything was complicated when he saw that we were with a dog…. He started to reproach us in every way. Explain to us that it was unacceptable to show up with a dog (French bulldog) and that he could not accept that we stayed more than one night and that it was impossible for the dog to stay...
We asked for the complaint book, he presented us with a book that did not correspond to the location, but from an establishment in Porto... we called the Police to find out the facts...

Chegados ao quarto somos recebidos por um quarto quente, não arejado escuro e exíguo.
2 camas, uma de cada casta, um roupeiro e uma mesinha já bem gastos.
A TV, que mais parece um monitor de computador, não tem os canais sintonizados, pelo que ou sabem sintonizar ou é apenas figura de decoração.
Ar condicionado? Tem o aparelho bastante antigo mas não funciona.
Abrir as janelas não é solução.
A casa fica ao lado da estrada nacional 15. O barulho dos carros é constante.

A casa de banho é exígua. Mal iluminada.
O poliban é claustrofobico.
Cerca de 1 metro quadrado com as portas emperradas fazem sentir preso.
Alguém mais “avantajado” terá sérias dificuldades em se mover dentro dele.

As camas tem colchões desconfortáveis, diferentes em cada cama.
Haverá colchões de palha mais confortáveis

O ambiente do quarto é triste, desensabido, sujo barulhento e desolador.

- corredor dos quartos cheirava super bem.
- bonita decoração de restaurante, corredores. Sugestão de melhoria: haver um degrau tipo 3 cm do chuveiro para o chao do WC- para água não verter.
- piscina interior 24h aberta mesmo aquecida. Top o aquecimento. Sugestão de melhoria : A noite é que devia haver luz fixa na piscina, pois ela é sensorial, e no caminho até lá, pois de noite é escuro. Mas a piscina super limpa e aquecida. Top top. Top.
- mesmo petfriendly, ve se que todo o staff gosta mesmo de animais e recebe e fala com humanos e da festas e carinho aos animais.

Rooms next to the dining place/reception are spacious. We were looking for the TV where we wanted to connect our computer. At first could not find it but it's behind the ""mirror"". Nice design idea but could not connect our cable :-). Clean and overall friendly staff though with some ladies smiling and some a bit less :-). Wellness out of order unfortunately. Gym was open. A lot of space outdoor and very pleasant when the weather is nice. The only thing which was rather poor value was the food (both breakfast and dinner).  Perhaps it was because we were there with a group and they tried to save costs, don't know. Not bad but not the quality you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Overall a good place.

Oddly, there was this vehicle constantly parked in one of the accesses which made it VERY difficult to go through with your car into your room location (some are pretty distant from the entrance).

Taxi should also be reserved for arrival beforehand. If you don't, it's a really hard walk about 150m on a serpantine upwards.

Rail station is pretty as well.",3 months ago,4
Paredes,hotel,Douro Palace Hotel Resort & Spa,Jamil Siddique,A lovely hotel and place to stay .  The location is awesome being down into the Douro valley close to the river .  Rooms are river facing so a lovely view in the morning .  Staff are great and helpful.  Food and dining is very good and great quality .  The rooms are ok and quite nice but the bathroom design and space could have been better . Is a bit tight and the only thing that lets the room down . Apart from that it’s a lovely place to stay .,5 months ago,5

Paredes,hotel,Douro Palace Hotel Resort & Spa,Monica Araya,"Fantastic place to relax, enjoy the views and experience a different Portugal, away from the usual cities. (Also a place for weddings and celebrations). The en prices are so fair and staff is friendly. Having an outdoors pool and an indoor pool is a fantastic part of the experience.

The only thing to keep in mind is that the staff seems to guided by local rules. Example:  They sent us in a taxi without warning us in advance that the taxi service would not take a credit card or the train service 😊 -- ideally they would warn non-Portuguese travelers who are no longer used to paying with cash.

Another example, they forgot our food order and our drinks too. It is not the end of the world, but a small feature as drink of courtesy is the standard practice in good hotels where mistakes are made.

Breakfast was very nice and with green views of the mountains and river.",9 months ago,4

The people are beautiful, we felt so loved and cared for, the whole time we were there!  Nothing is ever too much trouble and we were made to feel so welcome from arrival to departure.  The accommodation is both classy and tranquil and the infinity pool is stunning!

The attention to detail at this beautiful house is excellent, from the homely touches in the decor, the service, the cleanliness and the food - all are incredible!

Paredes,hotel,Casa de Campo - Castelo de Portugraal,Mel W,"A lovely family and a unique experience.

The castle is a natural stone built family home and a medieval guesthouse. But you are not just any guest, you are welcomed in style, as a friend and can enjoy a royal throne in your bathroom, a stained glass window in your bedroom, modern amenities nicely hidden in historic style and setting. The place is relaxed and the thick stone keeps you cool in summer, and probably warm in winter.

The garden has a few games giving you some leisure time, if you like.

But the best are the home cooked, amazing meals, breakfast (included) and reasonably priced (extra) dinners. All locally sourced, where possible, even from the own garden, decorated and cooked with love and a good hand and eye for aromas and presentation. You can taste the love that went into the cooking process .
We had chicken and duck, with roasted potatoes and rice respectively, garden vegetables. Yummy!

Começando com um acolhimento caloroso, onde os anfitriões D. Carla e Sr. Júlio, desde logo nos deixam dentro da fantasia de estar num castelo, também com os seus bonitos trajes medievais.
O espaço é rodeado de história, quer seja pelas suas inspirações medievais, como pela história familiar.
O espaço acolhe peças originais com detalhes cuidadosos em cada canto, quer interior como exterior. Nos dias de frio, a lareira aquece não só o ambiente, como a alma de cada um. ❣️
O pequeno almoço, vasto e variado, leva nos numa viagem de sabores com produtos tradicionais que nos fazem sentir em casa, e simultaneamente, num tempo distinto, potenciado pela decoração e agradável música ambiente. Destaco o café, um produto com uma origem tão especial, que se reflete no seu aroma e sabor inesquecível.
O jantar, como serviço à parte da estadia, segue a mesma linha de excelência, com produtos frescos e um menu criativo e saboroso, tirando o melhor partido dos produtos da época e locais, alguns deles da própria horta que existe no jardim! (A Cozinha é mesmo uma arte :))

Grab a coffee at the small cafe on the front in the town which is 2 min drive away.
There is no wheelchair access and there are some steps here so take this into account.
If you can't walk very well then you can still access the viewing point along but you will need to navigate some steps and a small slope

1 prato
1 garfo ( o garfo caiu ao chão e não trocaram)
O copo ( deve estar incluído no sumo que paguei) digo eu???

Acho uma estupidez o preço o valor em si.

Ou seja, despacham as sobras do almoço assim...

Penafiel,hotel,Penafiel Park Hotel & Spa,Karl S,"I recently stayed here and unfortunately, my experience was marred by several significant issues that raise serious concerns about the safety and standards of this establishment.

During our stay, we encountered a dangerous situation involving the high chairs in the restaurant. Despite the hotel's assurances, these chairs are clearly unsafe. When used by toddlers, they pose a risk of falling, which could lead to severe injury. It's unacceptable that the hotel suggests these chairs are ""safe if used safely."" Safety should be inherent, especially when it comes to young children, who cannot be expected to sit still or use a chair ""correctly"" at all times.

Moreover, the food safety practices at the hotel are equally troubling. We were served undercooked burgers at the bar, a serious health risk, particularly for children and vulnerable individuals. The hotel staff failed to ensure the food was cooked to the necessary safety standards, and their response to our concerns was dismissive, focusing on the wait time rather than addressing the real issue of undercooked food.

In addition to these concerns, our stay was further compromised by the lack of basic amenities and other safety issues. Despite requesting a cot/crib, none was provided, and we had to make do with a sofa bed. The children's playroom also posed safety hazards, with sharp corners, low exposed electrical outlets, and an exit leading to steep steps without proper separation—all of which are unacceptable risks for a four-star hotel.

Overall, the hotel's lack of attention to guest safety and well-being, as well as the dismissive attitude towards our concerns, is deeply disappointing. I strongly urge to reassess their safety standards and take immediate action to ensure the safety and comfort of all guests.",7 months ago,1

No housekeeping at night. It was better but still too dark . Twin bed was so narrow my husband almost fell out.

Penafiel,hotel,Penafiel Park Hotel & Spa,Fábia Vasconcellos,"Unfortunately, I had an unpleasant stay at the hotel. Starting, the room, it is absolutely outdated, very dark with old furniture scratched. The wall with paper wall with the image of a labour female on it made me totally uncomfortable. Also some strange smells, like mildew. I asked to change, the staff kindly showed a another room that was terrible like the first. However, smelling better and with a nature painting on the wall, I had to wipe the dust. I tried to close the bathroom door but doesn't work. Also, the jamb mass falls.
As I was on a work trip, I will appreciate having an iron, but it was denied, and I had to use the laundry service.
I had my first-day dinner in the restaurant, I ordered a risotto, that was extremely salted. I thought it was like it was a joke because  I had not wanted the bottle of water. A hole in the floor behind my chair in the restaurant.
My laundry comes back,and to my surprise, the skirt was completely wet. I laughed, as I was tired to complain about everything.

Penafiel,praia,Praia do São Jacinto,Stefan Bostock,"Probably one of the best beaches I’ve ever been to. Vast, wild, and empty (there were around 10 other people visible on the beach in later September). Could have watched the crashing building-sized waves indefinitely. They were so mesmerising that my partner passed out face down on the sand almost immediately. Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

Paisagem incrível do contraste das dunas com a floresta de pinheiros e arbustos, o passeio é relaxante e muito espetacular. É preciso pegar o autocarro ""Forte da barra"" que passa na Lourenço peixinho ou então pegar ele na estação rodoviária de Aveiro, descer no ponto Forte da barra (ferry). É preciso pegar a balsa para atravessar o mar. Descendo da balsa é possível seguir o caminho pelo Google maps que aparece se colocar na busca: 'Reserva natural de São Jacinto'. Foi um pouco difícil saber se estávamos no caminho certo, mas seguindo o caminho apontado no GPS você encontra primeiro a placa escrito 'Reserva São Jacinto' e vai reto por muito tempo, até uma hora encontrar um piso de madeira atravessando a estrada, você pode seguir tanto para a direita como pela esquerda, ou continuar reto que você conseguirá achar esse caminho da ponte que leva até a costa e a praia de dunas.
Na minha opinião poderia ter mais placas explicando os caminhos e rotas para chegar lá, pois fomos nos aventurando para chegar no local sem saber ao certo para onde estávamos indo.
É uma caminhada um pouco longa então é apropriado sapatos confortáveis e garrafa de água. O caminho na reserva é todo em solo arenoso, então pode ser que entre bastante areia no seu tênis.
A paisagem ao final da ponte é de outro mundo, vale muito a pena a caminhada. Depois pode se explorar essas outras rotas que existem por lá.",6 years ago,5

• acesso e estacionamento: o acesso dá-se em alguns trechos por ruas estreitas de mão dupla, mas que só passa um lado de cada vez, por isso em dias de maior fluxo para o local, considerar chegar mais cedo e sair mais cedo para não ficar “preso”no caminho ( se for de carro); Quanto ao estacionamento, quanto mais cedo, mais perto, mais tarde, mais longe será o lugar para guardar o seu veículo;
•acesso livre a todos sem taxas: todos podem frequentar a praia, bastando usar o bom senso que há famílias com crianças e pessoas mais idosas querendo também aproveitar;
• temperatura da água: diferente das praias de Portugal, tem a água mais amena, contudo a corrente de ar sobre a água é forte dando a sensação de muito frio;
•o local dispõe de algumas mesas e cadeiras rústicas;
•em parte há um relvado e em outro há areia com pedras ou somente areia;
• a praia apesar de ser razoável grande, a parte da areia é pequena, logo é bem disputada em dias  com mais pessoas.
• há muita poluição sonora por ser livre o uso de caixas de som ( isso é questão de sorte);
• aluguel de Canoa kayak: há uma tenda de aluguel, mas não sei os preços;

We came today, attracted by the laudatory articles and the result is frankly not what was announced. The water is dirty, full of algae which appears almost rotten, it would be interesting to clean the pool more often. The place is very small and frankly poorly located, the highway passes about 400m away, all in the middle of what looks more like an industrial zone than a pretty beach to relax on. The price is not justified in my opinion, paying 5€ per half day per person just to be able to sit at the water's edge with a really small body of water, it's expensive in my opinion. The place's bar is relatively expensive compared to what is offered (a few salads, as well as tostas mistas).
My only stars go for the extreme kindness of the staff, who were very pleasant and attentive.

Penafiel,praia,Marinha da Noeirinha,Isadora de Oliveira,"I went to the lagoon to swim in the afternoon with my husband. When we arrived, the first thing we did was paying the fee, €10. The receptionist was kind and gave us a bracelet and said with these exact words: you don't have to put it on, but if anyone asks, just show it. Ok, I put it in my pocket and didn't even think it was that important, after all, there were only about 10 people there and no explicit saying that it’s obligatory to use. We spent about 2 hours sunbathing, I noticed some employee looking at us weird and when we were about to leave, an employee yelled at me, extremely rude. Apparently, instead of coming politely to ask: “hey guys, can I see your bracelet” it’s better to make a scene for nothing. If I knew I would put this bracelet in my forehead with flowers to avoid this. Very uncomfortable and unprofessional, not to mention that 10€ is too much for what they were offering. The salty lagoon itself is nice, it was a pleasant swim for October (even though it’s already cold water).

Not everybody is naked but everybody just seemed to accept everybody else which was really impressive. After reading other reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect but I saw several couples sunbathing naked and nobody was bothering them at all. I also saw families in swim suits having a great time, seemingly oblivious to other people being naked. Of course there may be days when a bad apple spoils things for others but when I was there, clothed and naked people both seemed to be having a wonderful time and I had a perfect afternoon feeling completely free without any clothes.

The sea can be a little rough but I enjoyed padding with the large waves coming in around me. It was also not obvious to find but Google maps directed me to the path from the road to the beach and it was easy to park the car next to the road.",7 months ago,5

Porto,restaurante,Taberna Dos Mercadores,Ammara Khan,"Hole in the wall restaurant. It's fairly mysterious as they keep the door closed and you have to ring the doorbell to have someone come to the door and let you in once they have a table. Extremely tight quarters, which they have made excellent use of, including the walls above the tables that they are using as wine bottle storage which also doubles as decor. The staff was knowledgeable and pleasant. The restaurant was clearly very popular with locals as well as tourists. My favorite dishes were the octopus salad; the dressing was very tart which I found refreshing although it might be a bit overwhelming for some people. The garlic prawns were the standout dish of the meal; the prawns were well cooked, but the oil with whole pieces of garlic was the star. It was so good that we asked for bread to soak it up. The octopus rice had a crisp top, and the octopus was well done but I do feel that the rice was not to my taste. It was very salty and so perhaps would suit someone with a much higher salt tolerance than me.  We also had codfish croquettes - these were good as far as croquettes go, although I'm starting to think the texture is just not for me. Service was excellent.",2 months ago,5
Porto,restaurante,Taberna Dos Mercadores,Erzsebet Schrammel,"A Hidden Gem in Porto – Taberna Dos Mercadores

Tucked away in the heart of Porto’s old town, Taberna Dos Mercadores is an intimate, eight-table treasure that delivers an unforgettable dining experience. This charming spot, always fully booked, was bustling with life when we arrived. Luck was on our side—we managed to get a table after just five minutes of waiting, though after 8 PM, the wait time is considerably longer.

The food? Absolutely spectacular. We started with the codfish croquettes, golden and crisp on the outside. The fish soup was rich and comforting, packed with deep, oceanic flavors. And the shrimp in a frying pan—simply divine, with a garlic-infused sauce that begged to be mopped up with bread.

For the main course, we chose the lamb ribs with grilled potatoes, which were cooked to perfection—tender, smoky, and bursting with flavor. The veal liver Portuguese-style was a revelation, prepared with expertise, delivering a balance of richness and depth that delighted the palate.

Dessert was the perfect finale:
apple pie, the kind that wraps you in nostalgia with every bite. And the wines? Impeccable. The selection complemented the meal beautifully, showcasing Portugal’s fantastic viniculture.

With its cozy atmosphere, exceptional food, and warm, attentive service, Taberna Dos Mercadores is a must-visit in Porto. Just be prepared to wait—or, better yet, book ahead!",a week ago,5

Porto,restaurante,Chama,Devin Lynch,"Highly recommend Chama. The food, service, and ambiance were all top notch. We did a 7pm seating, and I think being in the earlier seating is key to a good experience here because it helps the restaurant keep groups on the same pace and focus more on hospitality rather than logistics.

The vibe felt like I’d been invited to a family meal. It’s genuinely intimate. Severs were friendly and thoughtful. The chef and bartender regularly walked amongst the tables mingling with guests, asking how folks liked their dishes and drinks, and sharing anecdotes. The food itself was phenomenal, and I found each dish to be substantial. I left satiated but not stuffed. Moreover, the value here felt good to me for a tasting menu of this size and duration as compared to experiences in NYC, Tokyo, and elsewhere in Europe.

I was on particular look out for issues that the small number of negative reviewers flagged - slow service, bland dishes, no fresh ingredients, gimmicky free drinks, etc. I feel that it is important to mention I experienced none of this. Time between dishes was short, and I ate more quickly than those around me.

Porto,restaurante,ZA IN PORTO,Sang Zoon Park,"Please try this place. This place is the Crown Jewel of all seafood restaurants in Europe. TRY THE OCTOPUS RICE. Tomato based soup, rich broth with plenty of octopus. Bay leaf and parsley add finesse. It is not only for your taste buds, but also for your soul.
The fried octopus fillet that comes with the rice is insaane. Chews like cod and chicken but has a scent of octopus. How is this even possible? What kind of sorcery is the chef practicing?????
The Grilled Cod is SO GOOD. Not like inferior American restaurants that simply roast every ingredient they have with cheap oil salt and pepper. This place serves oven roasted cod that has both firm and soft texture at the same time. Is this even possible mother of jesus. Springy flesh goes perfectly well with the crispy skin. The firm/soft flesh is only possible when the fish is fresh, not frozen.

Try the chicken soup too. I thought Korea has the best chicken soup but the chef here is making me betray my own country. Adding broken egg yolk to the chicken soup was a brilliant idea. Hats off to the chef. Please keep cooking.

We ate 2 chicken soup, glass of port wine, sparkling water, grilled cod, octopus rice, and dessert. But the bill was 67.25 euros. The only thing the chef is missing is business / pricing strategy. The food deserves higher price.

The owner(maybe the chef himself) serves and takes order. He is very polite and kind.",3 months ago,5

The francesiña is good too, I got mine with barely any meet but they sent it back and gave me more the next time which was nice.

Done!! The food was amazing we had the meat croquette which was stuffed full of Smokey goodness, then the whole deep fried crispy onion which was again delicious. The star of the show though was the Francesinh, we ordered the whole shared one which came in two bowls, one each with an egg on top of each. It was delicious every element was great!

Porto,restaurante,Taberna Santo António,Frank “BigEffsAdventures” McLeod,"Was recommended to go here by our accomodation as it was close, and was personally checked by them. Did not book, but was lucky enough to only have to wait a few minutes. Very cosy and atmospheric little place and the staff were truly amazing and friendly. It's a family run restaurant, and we felt like we were part of the family by the end of the night.
Diego helped us with our choices, and we had four different rissois (different fillings in each) all of which were flavoursome and well cooked. It was suggested we had the ham shank, and pigs cheeks and share them between us. An inspired choice, and one of the tastiest and succulent fall apart meals I have had. The mash was superb, the roast potatoes perfect, and everything blended together superbly to create a complete satisfying tasty meal. I had a chocolate mousse after, and it was incredibly rich, dense, and a very intense flavour. So good I almost licked the bowl!! Sadly I leave Porto tomorrow, but if I didn't, I know where I would be dining for as long as I was here. I normally don't return to places after a visit as there's so much to see in the world, but this Taberna could tempt me back to Porto in a heartbeat purely to dine here again and revel in the ambience, friendliness and immerse in the local custom with excellent food.

I think a reservation is probably prudent but we didn't visit during peak tourist season so probably could have gotten away with not doing it.
We were promptly seated. The service speak English but I would be mindful of taking it slow so you're understood.
I had the beef empanada while my other half had the beef capacio as a starter.
He had the ossobuco with polenta as main and I had the ribeye steak but opted for a salad due to a late lunch. For dessert we shared the brownie, not because we were still hungry but to you some thoughts 😂
The food was generous and tasted amazing! Please do give them a visit. I think price wise it was also value for money. I would certainly swing by again if I was in the neighborhood.

We ordered a croquette, cod, and pork cheeks. The croquette was the best I’ve had. It was indeed creamy and the inclusion of bacon added flavour but not salty. The cod was a disappointment tho. My friend & I was looking forward to it the most. Cod was rubbery because it was overcooked and the salt was not distributed evenly across the fish and parts were saltier. The chickpeas puree that came with the cod was good but cannot save the over dish. The pork cheeks was done perfectly! And the beetroot cauliflower purée was fantastic. We loved it but the pork cheek portion was quite small.

We asked if they served the food that they were known for and they said they change the menu every year. As my friend said, maybe it’s better that they stick to the older menu rather than change it frequently and cannot maintain consistency.

Still the views and staff makes this a worthwhile place to visit. Maybe the food will be better as reviewed by the others.",2 weeks ago,3

Atmosphere was so, so. If you are outside it will rain on your party as no effort has been done to solve the umbrellas placement.

Worse of all is having clearly uninterested waitresses that don't wait for the full order  of their table, forget it, spend 20min without check on us (we reached out other waitresses that had to take over).

I asked if I could use disposable chopsticks from a table nearby, but maybe my English wasn’t clear. I thought he did provide chopsticks to other tables, so I guess I just had to take them myself. Overall, it was a great meal, and I would recommend this place if you visit Porto 👍",3 weeks ago,5

You wouldn't believe how booming its business is. The food there is simply delicious. It leaves a lasting impression and is truly memorable.

Porto,restaurante,Cozinha das Flores,Jason Lei,"Booked this place for my wife’s birthday judging the reviews and photos taken plus the overpriced menu. Was expecting at least good service but was met with bad service and them taking away our dishes extremely quickly (before we finished our dishes) like they were in a rush (considering there was only like 3 tables including us).

The food was appalling. Way too expensive for what you get (not a first time at a fine dining restaurant but this is by far the worst “fine-dining” restaurant we had ever been to if we can even call it that). The food flavours were so bad that we had sent back their signature dish, it was so salty and overly sour (For €90 small lobster rice of that size, I would expect it to be a refined flavour for that price but got a horrid dish that we had 2 bites from). Had the dish replaced but got a mediocre filet of a fish that was smaller than a child’s hand for €30 and a pork shoulder that also tasted worse than the lobster for €30. The only good dish we had was the nata with caviar but was the dish was carried by the caviar as opposed to the nata which we could get a small tin for that price.

For the food quality I could do a better job cooking at home for 10% of the price and I don’t even cook. The food tasted like food from a person that just got out of high school and it was their first time following a recipe (if they even know how to follow a recipe) or they bought take away and put it on a plate and tried to add more flavour to make it sophisticated but turned out bad.

The drinks were also flavourless considering we ordered two easy to make cocktails which is universally available and easy to make.

All in all my wife’s birthday dinner was completely ruined and they even had the guts to ask for a tip and even asked how the food was (they were hoping for a compliment) considering we have sent back a number of dishes and have been quite vocal about the flavours.

I would avoid this restaurant at all cost! Complete tourist trap. My benefit of the doubt would be that the head chef was away and only the junior chefs were working as the chefs in the kitchen did look a bit young but it doesn’t excuse the fact that we are paying premium prices for well below average dishes!",4 months ago,1
Porto,restaurante,Cozinha das Flores,Pete Watts,"Exceptional service and experience! Amazing to see the open kitchen. Plus with the unexpected pleasure of having Nuno Mendes in person present and introducing some of the courses! We enjoyed every course immensely.

We had the rye and cornbread baked in cabbage, their sourdough, churned butter and local fish brandade couvert. Then the local chanterelles and roasted chestnuts in a stew with egg yolks and madeira wine, and the grilled and braised duck, escabeche of black trumpets and moscatel grapes starters, both were fantastic! We then had the grilled filet of beef maronesa, tender onions, bone marrow and walnuts, with sides tender leaves and aromatic herbs dressed in quince vinegar and fragrant flowers. and the roasted and grilled young potatoes, melted onions and egg mimosa.

Exceptionally prepared and served! The fillet of beef paired with the roasted potatoes and egg mimosa was a spectacular combination! Highly recommend a visit when in Porto!",2 months ago,5

The whole place had a homely vibe and we felt so very welcome. Some of the best, if not the best food we have had in Spain and Portugal combined over the last 2 weeks so far.

Edited - so good we went back a second time and it definitely held up to the same standard of amazing food and service. Everyone working here is lovely and the food is impeccable and delicious.

Porto,restaurante,tascö,Melanie Jensen,"After two different restaurants in Porto recommended Tasco to us, we knew we had to check it out—and it did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly at the door, and we could instantly tell that this would be a fun and lively dining experience.

The staff was young, friendly, and incredibly attentive, tailoring our meal based on our preferences. They not only recommended specific dishes but also suggested the best order to enjoy them. Every dish we tried was fantastic, but the standouts were:
•	Tuna Sashimi – The sauce was unreal, and the flavors were perfectly balanced.
•	Mushroom Starter – Rich, earthy, and packed with flavor.
•	Beef & Rice Mains – Cooked perfectly, hearty, and satisfying.
•	Desserts – We couldn’t choose, so we got both the lemon and chocolate-hazelnut options—both were incredible.

One of the most unique highlights was the slot machine cocktail experience. A bartender came to our table, asked about our preferred flavors, and then crafted a personalized cocktail right on the spot—it was a super fun and interactive touch!

Overall, Tasco delivers on both food and ambiance. If you’re looking for a memorable dining experience with great energy, creative dishes, and personalized service, this is the place to go. Highly recommend!",a week ago,5
Porto,restaurante,tascö,Max L,"Our dining experience at this restaurant was truly next level, exceeding all expectations. We were seated in a private room upstairs, which added an exclusive touch to the evening. The ambiance was exceptional—centered around a long, elegant marble table, with striking artwork placed directly on the floor, creating a sophisticated yet inviting atmosphere.

Our host, João, provided impeccable service, going above and beyond to ensure our experience was flawless. We began with a refreshing green sangria, which stood out for its balanced flavor—light, not overly sweet, and without the artificial taste often found in lower-quality versions. It was a perfect start to the meal.

The bread service was accompanied by a selection of flavorful spreads that were simply delicious. We then enjoyed a lobster soup with an incredibly rich and deep seafood flavor, elevated by a delicate wasabi foam that took it to another level.

For the main course, we indulged in perfectly seasoned and expertly cooked octopus, along with a medium-rare ribeye steak that was tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor. Every dish was beautifully presented, with thoughtful seasoning and flawless execution.

Dessert was equally impressive. The standout was a lemon filled with a luscious, creamy filling, complemented by rich dark chocolate. To our surprise, the restaurant generously added the rest of the desserts on the house, along with a perfectly crafted espresso martini.

As an unexpected and delightful touch, both chefs came out personally to greet us and ask about our experience—something rarely seen, even in the most exclusive dining establishments.

From start to finish, this was far more than just a five-star experience. Every detail, from the ambiance and service to the food and hospitality, was exceptional. This is a restaurant that truly understands the art of fine dining, and we cannot wait to return.",3 weeks ago,5

Then had the Angus steak with vegetables, French fries, and rice.  Oh man were these dishes delicious.  Had the chocolate and separate pumpkin desert.  SO good.  Finished this off with a 20 year Port and double expresso.  Special mention of the wait staff.  They continuously told us, ‘if everything is not perfect, send it back’.  They suggested the perfect Portuguese wines to complement our meal…Nothing went back…The challenge to this restaurant is to remain this way as Porto grows.

Porto,restaurante,Brasão Salgueiros,Tommy Levasseur,"Recommended by our hotel host, Brasão Salgueiros turned out to be an outstanding dining experience, combining flawless steak, traditional Portuguese flavors, and breathtaking views over the water.

A Setting Like No Other

One of the biggest highlights of Brasão Salgueiros is its stunning waterfront location. Arriving in time for sunset is a must—the golden light reflecting off the water creates an unforgettable dining atmosphere, making the experience all the more special.

Drinks & Starters
•	The white sangria was fresh, vibrant, and well-balanced, packed with seasonal fruit that elevated both the flavor and the presentation.

The Food: Rich, Bold, and Perfectly Executed
•	Francesinha: This dish often risks being too heavy or basic, but Brasão Salgueiros elevates it to another level. The perfectly cooked steak inside adds unexpected depth, while the rich, flavorful sauce pairs beautifully with crispy fries.
•	Oven Rice with Sirloin Steak: Though this dish took a little longer to arrive, the staff kept us informed of the delay, showing great attention to service. The steak was cooked to absolute perfection—medium-rare, juicy, and tender.

Service & Atmosphere
•	The staff was exceptional, providing warm, accommodating service that made the experience especially enjoyable for tourists.
•	The combination of waterfront views, a relaxed yet upscale ambiance, and impeccable service makes this one of the best dining experiences in Porto.

Final Verdict

Brasão Salgueiros isn’t just a steakhouse—it’s a destination.

Porto,restaurante,Rua Tapas & Music Bar,Becky Meehan,"I can't recommend this place enough, though you definitely have to book.
The atmosphere was fantastic, there was a real buzz about the place. Our server Julia was lovely, as were all the staff.
The food was amazing and generous portions. We had bread to start, then 4 tapas dishes between the two of us and this was plenty.
My favourite was the slow cooked pork cheeks though the burrata salad and chicken spring rolls were equally good. The patatas bravas were super crunchy like home made English crisps.
The live music was really enjoyable, a solo guy singing with a guitar.
We were in the first sitting of the evening, the booking was for 1 3/4 hrs, but as the time approached for the next guests we didn't feel at all pressured to leave.We decided ourselves to sit at the bar for our coffee to free the table. So maybe a word of warning, if you book the second sitting you may well be waiting a bit for your table, but it will definitely be worth the wait. My favourite place to eat so far!",3 weeks ago,5

We found this place by chance and enjoyed the great food, great service and amazing live music -she has an effortless angel like voice with great selection of songs- then we decided to come one more time before we leave Porto. The singer was different but he was also wonderful and and they had a great performance that we enjoyed to the fullest! If we come to Porto again, this place will be our first stop. I would suggest making a reservation beforehand, otherwise you might end up waiting in the line (especially during busy days such as Friday or Saturday). Many thanks!",a week ago,5
Porto,restaurante,Portucale,Emanuele Mangialardi,"Glad I came to try this restaurant that was on my list. The view of the whole Porto area is fantastic as it is placed on the 13th floor of a building in the Bonfim neighborhood.
I found the food good but a little old fashioned as the main dish comes with rice and veggies in one plate.
The ""bife a Portucale"" was a great combination with delicious sauce and mushroom. I found the spinach pure very tasty too.
The ""Cabrito"" had a little too intense but monotone taste but the texture and the cooking was perfect.
Great deal with the 30% discount on the fork",3 months ago,4

They offer real traditional Portuguese cuisine not a gourmet style. So if you want to try the traditional Portuguese cuisine in Portuguese way, here is the place you should visit.

The food was excellent, we took the set menu of €17, already includes the amuse-bouche, entree, plat, dessert, and chocolate. I think it was a super good deal! I super loved the fish tho, and also the dessert was very Portugese. The service was excellent as well. I would definitely come back here and recommend this restaurant! ❤️",a year ago,5

However, I hoped for a signature dish that would be more memorable.  For those who are adverse to raw food, it's advisable to inform the staff beforehand.  Notably, small pink shrimps were served raw, the pigion was uncooked, and the veal was merely seared on the outside.",6 months ago,3
Porto,restaurante,Le Monument,Dale Miller,"Worst dining experience I have ever had.  Presentation is good but that's where it stops, the taste of the food is horrible.   I've been to many Michelin star restaurants around the world.  This is the most expensive dinner at over $800 for 2 people and the worst food sadly.  We're so disappointed.  I did the wine paring and even the wines were disappointing especially for the price, which it tough to accomplish because there are so many incredible wines in Portugal.   The Cuddle fish was chewy and long, it got stuck in our throats, the lobster was under cooked, hard to cut and chewy and the veal was overcooked and tough to cut.    I mentioned this to the waiter, he mentioned it to the chef, the chef even came out and I said the above and he said thank you and would talk to the team and nothing else happened.  I also mentioned this to the front desk upon checkout as they asked and they said they would inform ""someone"" and again nothing happened. Not that I was expected anything.  Just lack of caring to go with the poor quality food.

Again if you want a 14 course of good looking plating, this is for you but if you want to enjoy the taste, don't go here!

The service team was exceptional though, it's not their fault I didn't enjoy the food.",9 months ago,1
Porto,restaurante,Le Monument,Tomson Chan,"Enjoyed our tasting menu here at Le Monument during our visit in Porto.

What standout for us was their super professional services and staff.  Very accommodating and friendly. They took the time to explain the dishes and the attention to details.

Tasty and delicious from the chefs including the desserts and pastry.
We would have enjoyed more if the lighting was brighter so that we can see well of their wonderful dishes (just a personal preference)
We chose the shorter menu around $200 per person and were really fulled at the end while we enjoyed the closing tea.
Highly recommended!",9 months ago,5
Porto,restaurante,Le Monument,David Borgert,"The chef and pastry Chef are clearly talented. At dinner, it was even mentioned that the pastry chef should just open up a bakery and she would put Ogi by Euskalduna out of business . A bit of an exaggeration, but we adored the baked goods.
For our experience, it wasn’t the back of the house so much as the front of the house that made us leave halfway through our meal granted we had been there for two hours already. The diaphanous formality of service and theatrical aspect of it just didn’t work for us. Where I was expecting service on par with Le Bernardin , we received storylines about the courses placed in front of us that had been memorized and told 1000 times over. It seemed forced and was awkward and uncomfortable for us to hear.
Speaking of comfort we were placed in a banquet. there was a vase of dried dead kangaroo paws (flowers) On the table, definitely not a good thing with the supposed caliber of this establishment.
Ultimately, why we decided to leave was if you were going to be sitting for 2 to 4 hours it better be very comfortable , and this banquet was not.  The cushions collapsed down to the plywood and was very hard to sit on, now mind you, I am all of 70 kg . I even did get up and walk over to another section and sit down to see if it was the same thinking perhaps we could just move, but it was the same.   I had a brief conversation with a lady next to me who also felt the same way.
We got up went to the bar (which is gorgeous) had an excellent Japanese whiskey paid the bill and left .",6 months ago,3
Porto,restaurante,Culto ao Bacalhau,Frederic B,"Dec2024: a «must-try» restaurant in Porto.
Fantastic Bacalhau dishes, super tasty (you. can forget your childhood memories of too dry/too salty fish) and seemed very traditional. Really brilliant service also - most attentive and friendly, solid advice. We liked the decoration and atmosphere a lot too - modern, classy but not formal. The wine list was impressive - we tried their local white wine and loved it.
Totally worth a 5 star in my book but only one drawback: the restaurant room is simply too cold in winter - heating or insulation problems? - it’s manageable with a jacket but may be better in other seasons.",3 months ago,4
Porto,restaurante,Culto ao Bacalhau,Frank Feeney,"We stumbled upon this restaurant last night with no idea of what the cuisine was, and it turned out to be our favorite experience in Porto. The restaurant was booked up, but they had an available table outside. We’re so glad we did, despite it being a bit chilly. The service and food were impeccable. Each dish was made with cod in a different way, including the dessert.

Our waiter, Miguel, was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and provided a level of service where we never felt rushed but also not ignored. You can tell he truly takes pride in his service and restaurant. They’ve just made the Michelin Guide as well. I could not recommend this more highly!",4 weeks ago,5
Porto,restaurante,Culto ao Bacalhau,Diego Castillo,"This restaurant is out of this world! It is very impressive the chef’s creativity to make dishes using cod (Bacalhau). The food texture and flavor was impressive, I did not expect Cod to taste that good. This is high cuisine, very elaborated and thought dishes. My congratulations to the chef! One of the most impressive dish was the dessert, using Cod collagen.

The service was wonderful, special thanks to Miguel and Donaldo. They were super funny and welcoming. They explained to us every single dish and also explained how Bacalhau is related to Portugal’s culture. Every waiter is very well trained, they know what they are doing. The timing of the dishes was perfect.

The atmosphere is great, it is cozy and elegant. I enjoyed the table and seating was comfortable.

This restaurant has high potential. I wouldn’t be surprised if they get a Michelin star someday. We had an amazing time here. It was our best restaurant in Portugal, and top 5 in Europe.",a month ago,5

We found the fish too salty and we made a comment to our server who promptly sent it back to the kitchen for the chef to check on. We were later told that since they found it below standard, they would remove it from the bill. We were recommended the fish skin dessert and we also ordered the creme brulee and sponge cake which were all divine. We were a group of 5 and we loved this restaurant.",a week ago,5

The selecions of wine 🍷 was really good.
The staff was friendly and helpful as they explained to us every single dish and give good recommendations.

Porto,restaurante,Badio restaurant,Jonathan S. Ng,"After a quick Google Maps search for steakhouses with 4.5+ stars, Badio appeared to be a strong contender for a good steak dinner. Reservation was easy to get via WhatsApp, and the staff were welcoming and multilingual (Portuguese, Spanish, English).

In terms of the dishes served, despite the reviews on Google Maps, the food proved to be quite disappointing overall, with the appetizers drowning in a curry-like sauce that was entirely overwhelming in flavour. To the steak that we ordered medium and came out well-done, dry, and frankly horrifically bland. The creamy mashed potatoes were equally poor quality, tasting like microwaved instant mashed potatoes, and having a soupy-quality to it.

Perhaps the only saving grace of the meal, was the decent cookie souffle with vanilla ice cream. Overall, I cannot recommend Badio due to the incredibly poor food quality, however I do compliment the staff for their attentiveness, professionalism, and friendliness to tourists.",4 weeks ago,3

Porto,restaurante,Café Restaurante O Afonso,Sally M.,"I’m so shocked to read the glowing reviews of this place. We were of course going off that Anthony Bourdain recommendation but, wow how things must have changed since then. First, our waiter was so rude to us it was ridiculous. His obvious disdain was palpable. In between ignoring us and dropping 5 peanuts on the table with dirty plates, the waiter would snatch our glasses off our table that still had a quarter full of beer in them. The service was dreadful and they should be ashamed. All the waiters were storming around with glares on their faces. And as it was our first meal in Porto, so it was not a great feeling. The francesinha took an hour, and it wasn’t great. The sauce was so bitter with an off flavor. The accompanying fries were completely soggy and limp, no salt, no flavor. There are a million other places to go, don’t come here.",7 months ago,1

Can only visit through a private tour (booked via airbnb). They don't often show up, so be sure to check. You can also email the host to inquire about additional opportunities.

This house is STUNNING. The outside literally stands in stark contrast to the treasur inside. The son of the original family spent decades and untold fortunes collecting the masses of porcelain, paintings, tapestries, furniture, and my favorite building out the walls, stairs, and ceilings.

Many large pieces from decommissioned churches include alters, doors, and a stunning pulpit at the top floor.

The full history of the house is still being researched, which I think adds to the allure of the property. Limited information allows you to just soak in the work of art this house is.",2 years ago,5

I walked there 1h to ring at the door and be welcomed by a ""Yes ? What do you want?"". I asked the lady if I could visit and she told me I needed to book first, I couldn't even explain to her the website for it was crashed that she closed the door. I'm speechless to how she quickly shut me off without proposing me to book a tour. Really disappointed I couldnt see the place but glad I didn't have this rude lady as a tour guide.",2 months ago,1

Porto,museu,Casa Museu Fernando de Castro,Oliver Hutchison,"One of a kind house museum dedicated to an exceptionally prolific collector of decorative arts. Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the former owner lined every surface of his house with materials and objects recovered from predominantly religious institutions - wood carvings, ironwork, paintings, sculptures, furniture, brocade curtains, gilt mirrors and so on, adapting the objects to fit the space available, which at times meant cutting off parts of canvases or trimming away some acanthus leaves to make a carving fit over a doorway. Walls, ceilings, floors, doors and windows are all encrusted with antique decorations including an ornate pulpit in the stairwell, a stained glass window as a skylight, a gilt gate from a church altar, and a domestic scaled hall of mirrors in the main sitting room. You'll enjoy this one regardless of whether you think it's ""tasteful"", so make the effort! Keep in mind that you need to book by email (see their website) and it's a guided tour (inexpensive at just €5), but we were in a group of just 6 people one Thursday morning and our guide was lovely.

I read about a teacher who suggested to their students to choose a piece of art and look at it for three hours. The idea has stayed with me (I don’t think I would make it, but someday maybe I will try try 15 minutes). I made a point of taking 3 breaths in front of each picture in that section of the museum.

If you’re visiting Porto you will definitely visit the Clérigos Church and Tower so while you’re there; why not visit this “Hidden Gem”which is a hundred yards further up the hill .
I call it a “Hidden Gem” because I walked past it twice before I spotted it. (In my defence there was no signage on the building).
This was formerly a prison and dates back to 1767 so it’s worth visiting even if you’re not interested in photography just to see the massive walls and iron gates that kept the inmates inside.

There are a number of small exhibits and collections on the ground and second floors including a very interesting one on the part photography played in criminal investigation and also cataloguing prisoners.

The icing on the cake for me though, was the very impressive collection of cameras and photographic equipment on the top floor ranging from the earliest of equipment to more modern times.",a year ago,5

The ambiance is modern and sleek, and the staff were super friendly and welcoming.

The exhibition is compact but very engaging: you can touch the exhibits, conduct small science experiments, and learn about water in an interactive way. This makes it especially fun for children, as learning here feels like play. It’s best suited for kids up to around 11 years old.

Another great advantage is that the pavilion is located in the huge Parque da Cidade, where you can easily spend the whole day. After visiting the museum, you can take a walk, have a picnic, or simply enjoy nature.

Initially, the exterior of the building appears unremarkable. Even upon entering the first exhibit room, one might assume that the museum consists solely of a few paintings. However, this is not the case. There are two additional floors and a basement to explore.

Fortuitously, the museum guide was available and provided us with a comprehensive tour of the premises, offering detailed explanations of each exhibit. The house itself is quite unique, showcasing a distinct style on each floor. There is an impressive collection of furniture, which can be considered art in its own right. The furniture has been meticulously sourced from various locations, and the guide informed us that due to space constraints, some pieces are displayed in other public institutions.

The experience was really fun and felt like a huge playground. We were two adults but it was like we were kids again. It was really nice!

I don’t think it’s an experience for everyone but if you like to have fun and are a kid at heart then it’s for you. In fact I think that kids will enjoy it too.

Porto,museu,Museu do Holocausto do Porto,Henry Cohn,"I would give this 2.5 stars if I could as I have an entirely mixed view of my visit. This is a small museum, when I visited today there was very significant security present: two police outside the building, two personnel inside, asking all belongings to be put in lockers with no photos allowed. The personnel informed me that the high security was “as demanded by the Portuguese law due to the war in the Middle East”. This was after attempting to visit the nearby Kadoorie Synangogue as a tourist, which was closed, with two police outside it and a member of the community advising tourists to visit this museum instead. I am not going to remark on whether or not this level of security is justified but for context, I saw a large swastika spray-painted on a building within 1km of these sites.

The museum begins with an excerpt from the 2020 film “A luz de juda”, detailing an episode relating to Porto’s intake of Jewish Holocaust refugees, and this appears to have been filmed on location at the Kadoorie Synagogue.

The stand-out exhibit is a multitude of visas granted to Jewish Holocaust refugees for entry to Portugal, which appear to have a number of different sources, with some in French and others in Portuguese. The signage in the museum did not explain why this took place in the context of Salazar’s dictatorship of Portugal. I am now searching Google for results regarding this and it appears to be a very interesting history, so it is a shame that there was not information regarding it.

Aside from this, there were also displayed the films taken during the liberation of the concentration camps and some bunk beds designed to look like the beds used in the camps.

At the end there was an explanation of the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the names of the six Portuguese gentiles who were awarded the Yad Vashem’s “Righteous Among the Nations” for saving Jews during the Holocaust. I am glad that the museum did not shy away from the topic of Holocaust survivors who sought refuge in Israel, which from the statistics displayed there was the vast majority of survivors. However, the brief history given of Israel was very staunchly pro-Israel, which I found struck a sour note at the end of this small museum. Of course, no brief history of something so complex will ever be uncontroversial. But in particular, I must highlight that in the English translation at least, this part of the museum regarding Israel referred to the loss of 1 million Jews from the Arab world post-Holocaust as “the Arab Holocaust”. Yes, this is a topic to which the world has not paid due attention. But for a Holocaust museum of all places to compare other events to the Holocaust was for me extremely disappointing. I would be equally offended by comparisons of the Nakba with the Holocaust, because I believed that part of the raison d’être of memorialising the Holocaust was precisely to highlight the almost unique scale and almost unique depravity of this tragedy in history. The phrase “Arab Holocaust” is not something that returns search results on Google, nor was it a phrase I had ever heard before.

Furthermore, upon looking at the images other reviews here, I am reminded of the rather out of the blue diatribe about the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which the museum describes as something like a particularly mainstream form of antisemitism today. I had overlooked how appropriate it was to include this message because I was quite emotional after seeing the rest of the museum. In hindsight, I think this is a completely inappropriate message to addend to the memory of the Holocaust, and makes me wonder if the museum were truly designed for the purpose of Holocaust education. To paraphrase a more succinct review here, it is rather like half the museum is an ad for Israel. There was a large school group present at the time of my visit so I did not read many of the signs after reaching the Israel propaganda section, before leaving",a year ago,2

We should be more friendly and flexible with the hours, to reach more people. A space that opens 3 hours a day, it’s not doing much favor to spread the message that it was suppose to.",3 years ago,3
Porto,museu,Museu do Holocausto do Porto,Jailton Martins,"I would not recommend this museum because I was the very first visitor when the institution opened for the public visiting. But for my surprise I was very bad received by the guard who was at front of the line, a portuguese man. He was very rude to me maybe because I am brazilian and I speak with brazilian accent. He said I wasn't welcome there cause I was wearing shorts. How come?! This protocol was not recommended by no media paper or even in TV when they were inviting people to visit. Besides there were many other people in shorts at the big line formed in front of the museum. I have visited many Holocaust museums before. So I was very interested in Porto one. My interested in visiting this museum was turn into shame because of a detail not shown even in website of the museum. I didn't know wear short is disrespectful in a jew museum. Because in these other museums didn't ask me that. Buenos Aires, Montreal, Brazil. This protocol is unknown. Im not jew and I would not disrespect the religion if I knew in advance the Porto museum forbids men wear shorts. If this was really the reason of blocking me... Which is very ironic, unfortunately, considering the message of tolerance hidden in a jew museum. Of course I argued with the body guard and I was allowed to visit at last. But this situation put me down and I really don't want to stay there never more in my entire life. Shalom.",2 years ago,1

Some tour participants also complained about seeing the appearance of astral creatures (haunted).",3 months ago,2
Porto,hotel,Golden Tulip Porto Gaia Hotel & SPA,Dan C,"The hotel is close to the beach and the customer service is good. It’s all downhill from there.  There is a lot of mould in the shower tiles and ceiling over the shower.  The A/C doesn’t work from the room itself, we had to ask the front desk to turn it on.  As it turns out, the A/C was showing an error message from their end and so they turned it on every few minutes after the A/C would shut off on its own. For €127/night I was extremely disappointed.  Some of the lamps don’t work as well in the room.  I will be requesting a partial refund.  I’m 35 years old and I travel a fair bit, staying in many hotels around the world, and I can confidently say that this is in one of the worst 3 experiences I have ever had in a hotel.  It’s by far the worst hotel I’ve ever been in when I consider the price.
Considering how bad my experience has been, I believe that many positive reviews on here with no comments added are false reviews. You can see by clicking on the profiles that many of them don’t have any reviews for other businesses. Meaning that accounts were likely created by a third party company to hired manage businesses’ bad overall review scores.  This is unethical.

The room is boring, absolutely no personality, but somehow made it look good in the pictures. The shower has 2 shower heads with 1 of them not working. We had to go downstairs and ask them to turn on the AC at the front desk, but it switched on and off every couple minutes. We called the front desk and they said they have an error and the AC does not work in our room. We did not expect the room to be this disappointing for €127 PER night. Luckily the front desk guy was very nice and welcoming. The location is okay but I would NOT recommend nor would i stay here again.",5 months ago,1

The service was exceptional—particularly the gentleman who served us; he spoke every language of the guests in the room, and his English was excellent. The limited food choices encouraged me to try dishes I wouldn’t normally choose, and I thoroughly enjoyed everything, expanding my palate in the process. Well done to the entire team for providing great service, an amazing view, and very good value for money.",10 months ago,5
Porto,hotel,Golden Tulip Porto Gaia Hotel & SPA,Stewart Cartwright,"I hope the owner reads this, I present my review with genuine desire to see improvement.

This hotel is an example of wasted potential.

In desperate need of investment as it could be the premier location to stay, eat, party, rest, play and explore Gaia Porto.

A few points:
1. The pool and gym are like and abandoned building. There is mould on your room, paint peeling from the poorly removed jacuzzi, the maintenance of the water in the pool is poor, the gym is low quality, the spa and Turkish bath are a safety hazard that will likely get you sued for an OHs violation when someone injures themselves. The control box makes it look decrepit and run down.
2. The outdoor area looks cheap and hastily thrown together with no thought or care.
3. The champagne lounge being closed looks like a horror attraction at a fair you go into to get scared for fun.
4. The staff seem so disengaged through what I believe is lack of management or ownership support to fix anything so they do the bare minimum.
5. Rooms are nice but the bathrooms are terrible. Bad plumbing, horrible shower set up with the silly small bath tub and shower head that's so low only a 4""5 person would comfortably shower.

I love the location and feel that whomever owns this hotel should do a facility audit, pull a plan together from feedback of guests, staff and the locals to have it be THE PLACE TO STAY IN PORTO GAIA

Happy to discuss more",7 months ago,2

Porto,hotel,Hotel Jaguar,Audrey Lord,"We chose this hotel for our last night in Portugal to be close to the airport. I don't think their ""free airport shuttle"" is very useful since it only operates 8am - 8pm! That means it's only good for outgoing flights from 11am or later so you have time to get through security, or flights arriving by 730pm or so since you'd need to get your luggage.
The rooms were well stocked and included a fruit plate, water, and cookies which was a nice surprise! The rooms were clean except for a gross stainless steel toothbrush cup in the bathroom - who is using that anyway?!? 🤢
Aside from that, all looked good. Oh, beware about taking anything - there's a price list in the bathroom: $400 for the TV, $25 for the slippery mats by the bedside, some amount for the scale. Nutso. Who's stealing bathroom scales??
The common areas were compact but we didn't hang out there anyway. Street noise made it hard for my husband to sleep. Oh, and if you open the window it's way different than the USA - like, it opens fully, no screen, no safety measures to keep people from falling out!

My biggest (and probably only problem) with the room was the bad thermo isolation, which made the room quite chilly (early December). An electric radiator style heater was available in the room, and setting it to max was barely enough to keep it lukewarm.

Porto,hotel,Oportocean Hostel & Suites,kicosmaria,"I am a home owner in the area of this Hostel.
This hostel is a bad place to stay, facing a highway-like road with absolutely NO OCEAN VIEW, and they are absurdly disconnected from the neighbourhood they are inserted in. They do not care one bit for any of the houses around them, they do not keep the piece or care to have any kind of relationship with their surrounding neighbours, being the most arrogant, self-centered and entitled people to ever represent the beautiful city of Matosinhos.
Because of them our surrounding gardens have been constantly vandalised and destroyed because they neglect to inform their guests that their GPS coordinates cross through other people´s private property, while littering, breaking fences and overall breaking the peace.
If there was ever a reason to be against AirBnb´s or Hostels in this gentrified era Portugal, Oportoocean Hostel & Suites re-incarnates the ultimate reason and argument to hold against.",5 months ago,1
Porto,hotel,Oportocean Hostel & Suites,Fadi Sakr,"My wife and I stayed in a private room here while walking the Camino de Santiago. It's not very close to the Camino, and it took around 25 minutes to walk there. But if you do not want to walk, the tram line is very near, and it is one stop from Matosinhos. It's also very possible to take the tram to go to town for dinner, which is what we did. The room was very nice, clean, and very comfortable. Staff was very helpful. Breakfast was good.",10 months ago,4

Porto,hotel,Avenue View Rooms,Territorio Beréber,"I had a terrible experience at Avenue in Town Hostel. I had a confirmed reservation, but when I arrived, the staff member, a Brazilian man named Juan, refused to acknowledge it. He repeatedly said “No, no” without even checking my booking. Another guest arrived, and we entered together, but Juan still insisted I had no reservation.

When I tried to show my confirmation, he refused to look at it and instead called the police, claiming I was a stranger trying to enter illegally. I was treated like a criminal for no reason, which was both humiliating and frustrating.

Because of this, I was left without accommodation late at night, struggling to find another place to stay. This was an unacceptable and unprofessional experience. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone looking for reliable service and respectful treatment.",2 months ago,1

Porto,hotel,Lusitana Hotel,Alexander Khomyak,"Very friendly staff (hello Fernande), in everything they meet. For example, they brought a kettle to the room, which is not in the standard set. They also showed decency by reporting forgotten things at the hotel (we were able to pick them up on the way back). I was also struck by the fact that you can book a room without paying just by calling the hotel and telling the dates and the required rooms. It is located in a quiet place not far from the historical center. There is a small but cozy patio with two tables where you can sit with a laptop, have a bite to eat or just relax from the hustle and bustle of the tourist city. The photo shows a view from the second floor of a single room (street view) and a double room (looking into the courtyard).

Porto,hotel,Lusitana Hotel,Yeesh Rose,"Brilliant hotel in a quiet area but not too far from the centre (walking distance). Yes the rooms are cosy but they’re spotlessly clean with all the amenities present for a comfortable stay. The staff was also friendly and they allowed me to use the main iron and also stored my bag after check out so that I could continue exploring. The hotel is also staffed 24/7 so you need to buzz the front door to get in which means it’s highly safe. The only downside is that the rooms are thin so you can hear people coming up and down as well as the shower being run next door. For me that was a minor as everything else was superb and I felt safe as a solo traveller. Oh, they also provide you with a map upon arrival which is handy but Google maps/Moovit on your phone works just as fine. Will definitely stay here again upon my return to Porto and great value for money!!",2 years ago,5

The positives points: the staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful, so thank you for that. And the localisation is very convenient to go to the airport and city center!
The rooms are spacious and good enough but some amenities are missing (there’s only soap and lotion, no slippers for example) for a 4 stars hotel, it’s not very good. Coffee is only given the first day and wasn’t given again even if we asked for it.
The breakfast is alright, there’s not that many choices so it can get a bit repetitive if you stay many nights.

There are large bottles of shower gel, shampoo, body lotion and hand wash which is great. The reception staff are so friendly and helpful and nothing is too much bother for them, particularly the lady with the dark curly hair (we didn’t get her name) she was very pleasant and also the man with the beard on reception helped us fix an issue we were having with our blinds which was much appreciated. My wife does not like elevators and the reception staff opened the door for us to use the stairs when they saw us coming into the hotel each time before we even had to ask them, which was excellent service. The hotel is right beside a metro station which unfortunately for us was too far away from the centre as we had to get two metros to the centre, however this is nothing to do with the hotel, just something to note if you plan on going to the centre often as the metros can be very busy and we had to change lines each time.

About the windows, not even the covers are properly maintained, it is a lie that they call theirself ""hotel"", because a hotel is for resting, and you won't rest here...

Cons - not a hotel more like a hostel,
students everywhere hogging tables in bar by placing laptops cables phones everywhere no where to sit for paying guests

Room - poor for the money, no kettle, coffee etc, our room hairdryer didn't work.  Double bed was 2 singles pushed together, 1 bed creaked every time you turned over or got out waking the other up.

Taxi or Uber needed everywhere you go.

Breakfast - what total carnage - surrounded by students, who just hogged everything toaster don't think it's an easy task to get toast it's not! Poor selection of hot food really salami sausage and scrambled eggs, coffee machine well cappuccino is hot chocolate!!

Staff - lovely however students run a mock in their pyjamas oh and the noise level at midnight is unreal, it's a no smoking hotel but they all stand by open doors smoking so they may as well sit in the bar.

Porto,hotel,room Select Porto Suites,SP,"The bright smile and friendly welcoming of the reception staff was memorable.

Porto,hotel,room Select Porto Suites,Artemi Bendandi-Marketou,"The rooms are marked as having 3 stars on Google Maps and Booking, but upon arrival we saw on the building itself that the facility actually has 2 stars.
Long story short: if you are a light sleeper, don’t book here. Our room was on the 7th floor and the noise from the street was still too much. There is traffic during the night, as well, so it’s impossible to sleep with an open window. There were several noise sources in the room itself, including the fridge and ventilator. There is a very bright billboard on the other side of the street playing video ads, so to sleep you would need earplugs and a sleep mask.
Bathroom: there was no backup toilet paper, and no toilet brush, which we found baffling.  The bathroom ventilator didn’t work, and the bathroom has no window, so no other means of ventilation. On the first morning, there was a drain smell from the bathroom. I also spotted a couple insects.
Location: the location is good, close to the metro Trindade and to walkable distance to basically everywhere in the city center. The only issue is that the buildings nearby are dilapitated, but it’s Porto, so that is basically inescapable. There’s two good nightlife areas nearby.
Cleanliness: the rooms were clean and spacious.",6 months ago,2

Porto,hotel,room Select Porto Suites,Howard Roberts,"In early June 2023, it’s actually a pretty nice place for 2 people to stay, but apartment 21 has its faults. (1) The kitchenette is well equipped except for the lack of its own lighting. I had my choice of turning on the lights for the entire living area, or using my phone flashlight. (2) More seriously, during much of the day (but not at night), a whiff of sewer gas permeates the apartment. I suspect positive air pressure in the waste water system is the cause. Properly installed air pressure attenuators would probably mitigate this problem.",a year ago,3

We we're a bit afraid from the booking Photos. We had room 102. We we're surprised that the beds and the bedding were nice and clean.

Sadly the bathroom didn't have any ventilation (there was some fan but probably stuck) so it was very misty and there were somewhere also pubes.. wasn't very clean, but it worked.

There is no AC and our room was getting quite hot so we had to keep the window open.

Sadly the hotel is on a really busy main street going on a bridge so it was really noisy all night Long with lots of loud revving bikes. Some rooms don't look it no the street so guess that's not issue in those.

This place doesn't accept cards so don't forget to bring cash !

The WiFi was fine actually.

It's very old fashion.. the staff depending on the Day (changing) were not caring or Nice.

Beware if you have big luggage. I saw that there is an elevator in the photo, yet there are actually some stairs from the ground floor to the first floor where the elevator is located. So I have to carry my big heavy luggage up the stairs when I arrived, luckily the staff helped to carry it down when I did the checkout.

Porto,hotel,Axis Porto Business & SPA Hotel,Valerie Brotherton,"The hotel is very far from the centre of the city. We didn’t want to stay in the city because we only intended to stay 1 night.  But there aren’t any restaurants or shops close to the hotel so unless you have a car or use transit your options for dining will be limited to the hotel restaurant.  We ate at the lounge one night and it was not good.  All they were able to offer us late at night was a ham and cheese sandwich with potato chips.  The potato chips were the best part of the meal.

There is a 5 EU charge to park in their lot but it is a very steep incline to get to the lot and difficult to maneuver so we parked our rental car on the street.  There is no problem with parking behind the hotel.

The room was clean and well maintained but it is very small.  The staff are friendly and try very hard but we found not too knowledgeable.  We asked about finding a hospital as my husband had to go to emergency and the gentleman told us it was only 4 blocks away.  It was over a mile away.  We walked over a mile to get to the emergency department where we spent 11 hours.  We had to book another night because we were too late to get to our next destination.

When we called the hotel to book for another night they said they only had 1 room left but they would not hold it with our credit card.  It is against company policy.  If the room was gone when we got there – too bad.

They cater to tour groups.  There were 2 tour groups and the breakfast room was very loud and crowded with the tour groups getting ready to leave.  Breakfast was uninspired.

This is not a 4* hotel but a basic 3*.  It is very isolated and we did not feel it was good value for the money.",4 months ago,3

We had a room at the back on the 2nd floor, which was in a  quiet neighbourhood. The bed was very comfortable with loads of pillows and the amenities were good, including a bidet and a decent hair dryer in the bathroom and a safe as well as coffee and tea making facilities. The shelf space around the wash hand basin was limited, but we managed and the shower was good.  The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. This was the best feature of the hotel. Reception, bar, and restaurant teams were all lovely. Our safe battery failed and the reception and maintenance guys went out of their way to resolve things quickly for us. The food was a decent, plentiful buffet at breakfast which was included, and dinner was good value.

The rooms are made for two people, but the beds are separate so you don't have to share with your travel mate. The location is in the heart of Porto, the people nearby are quiet. And for 60 euros a night, this is one of the best deals in Porto.

There are two laundry machines in the flat, one is in the kitchen, the other (wash&dry) in the common bathroom with a tub. The kitchen has everything you might need, and the stove+oven are new. A small balcony is a great place to have breakfast or morning coffe/tea because it is in the shade. The building is located on a small peaceful street, all I heard were seagulls all the time.

Porto,hotel,City Heart Rooms,Gabriella Metrucci,"Bed bugs, incredibly horrible experience.This was the worse stay of my life, I booked for 3 days and after spending two nights with the whole body itching, despite I brought my own bed sheets and thinking that it was due to dust allergic reaction as the place was generally not very clean, on the last night I woke up at 4am discovering that the bed was full of BED BUGS. I had to take antistaminics due to an allergic reaction that also involved my breathing and my body is still full of bites and itchy after one week.
I left in the middle of the night disgusted and I reported this to the property owner that didn't seem to take the issue seriously, and he was also very rude calling me a lier until I sent him pictures. Bed bugs don't go away with a steamer, they are pests and a very serious hygiene and health issue, that I have reported to the relevant local authorities, hoping for further action.
Places like this should not accept guests until they completely solve the issue with pest control.

Porto,praia,Praia da Granja,Petru,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I recently visited Praia da Granja, and I have to say, it's one of the most beautiful and tranquil beaches I've ever been to! Just a 30-minute train ride from Porto, it's the perfect escape for anyone looking to enjoy some peace by the sea.

The beach itself is pristine with soft golden sand and crystal-clear water. It's never too crowded, which makes it ideal for relaxing, soaking up the sun, or even taking a leisurely swim. The beach is well-maintained, and I noticed the lifeguard services during the summer, which gave me extra peace of mind.

One of the best things about Praia da Granja is the beachfront bars and restaurants. I had some amazing seafood at a local spot with the most beautiful view of the ocean. The overall vibe is laid-back and charming, with a welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

I also loved the quiet, residential area surrounding the beach. It's a great spot for a stroll, and the gardens around the area are simply gorgeous.

Overall, Praia da Granja is a hidden gem that offers the perfect combination of relaxation, beauty, and convenience. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting Porto or looking for a peaceful beach escape!",a week ago,5

You can buy wind-screens with chairs for the price of €10,- ....is ok. There are also quite some beach bars. It was quite easy to get there bc of good connection with the main station of Porto, the way back is more complicated though. Overall I would return.",2 years ago,4

The price is, as known in Portugal, very low for the quality dishes you can order here.

The best dishes for me, which also where probably the most expensive for 8€, are the Burger Especial gom Batatas, and the Francesinha Especial (on picture)

The Francesinha is a very typical plate, which is actually nothing else than a overpowered ""croque monsieur"", embedded with an special home made sauce, which consists of Mayonnaise , Ketchup , many sorts of Alcohol, which gives the Fransesinha in here a very authentic touch.

Take a Port Vine (""Porto"") whenever you want, and you will not be disapointed.

By the way, she later conversed with me in English. The soup was so salty and half cold. It felt like it was cooked a long time ago and they used a microwave to heat it up. The main dish also was so salty and taste-less. I think their chef is heavy on salt. The ambience was okay. They tried to impress me with the fresh seafood on display at the front. But overall experience is terrible since the food is sub-par. There's this Michelin rated sticker at the front door which is surprising. I would not go back to this place.",2 years ago,1

We were disappointed to find a lot of bones in the fried fish. They even fried parts that consisted completely of bones or inedible parts like the tail.

Thank you Joana for taking care of your guests. You’re doing it right. After ordering we asked for water and  D. Carolina said her job is working in the kitchen and her employee would take the order. Maybe the table in the corner which seemed like regular (wealthy) guests deserved all D Carolina’s attention.  It’s very common that in Portugal that restaurant owners truly believe in the good taste of the food. Although it’s very easy to find it in any other restaurants.

The breakfast room was pleasant, offering a nice variety of options. The hotel provides coffee and tea 24/7, which, while not the best quality, was still a nice convenience.

The location is fantastic, with easy access to the promenade area, restaurants, a supermarket, public laundry service, and even a McDonald's, all within walking distance.

A special shoutout to Guilherme Nogueira, an outstanding employee who was always willing to help and incredibly polite, making him the perfect representative of the hotel.

This guest house is literally across the street from the train station.  It was 3.6 Euros to Porto. Joana, the operator,  is wonderful.  I arrived 3 hours early while they were still cleaning rooms and Joana allowed me to keep my backpack in storage while I had lunch. She also answered all my questions beginning with simple things like how the combination lock doors open and the password to the wifi network.  If you read this review, then you will already know that to open your room door, you enter the combination code they'll send you, pull the door, then push it. You want also know that the network password is posted just outside the door. I loved the rooms. They are clean and modern with big windows allowing plenty of light in. There's a fridge with supplies available for a fee posted on the inventory page. They store bicycles, backpacks, and umbrellas on the first floor. A community kitchen is available for use as well.

Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Hotel Suave Mar,Irina S Dimitrov,"Probably the worst breakfast experience I've ever had. I've been in hundreds of both cheap and expensive hotels since I used to travel for a living and I've seen some bad breakfasts but at least they were in cheap places, with no pretentions. This hotel though had poor, cheap buffet options, shot glasses for water so we had to refill numerous times just to get a full glass of water, grey!!! hotdogs floating in ugly water, and bitter scrambled eggs (did they put baking powder in them?). Inexplicable breakfast for such a beautiful hotel in such a great location. Rooms are not cheap, so is management trying to make even bigger profits by saving a few euros for breakfast? For people who always choose specific hotels primarily for location and breakfast, this was very disappointing. The breakfast staff, including the person who's seemed to be the manager, were walking around like hawks, watching guests to make sure... to make sure what, that we don't get an extra slice of the cheapest ham in town? Weird experience. I got angry at some point because I kept having to get up for mouthfuls of water, so I grabbed a pitcher of water out of the two that were in the main buffet area and brought it to our table. We were tired of walking back just to fill our shot-sized glass with water, and the manager immediately came to our table probably to ask why I'd taken the pitcher. Thankfully, he had the presence of mind to not ask that when he saw me refill our small glasses several times in the span of 1 minute, and instead asked if I needed water. That saved him from me shaming him and the entire hotel right then and there for the joke this experience was.

It's telling of the quality of hospitality in Portugal, where they think that by charging the higher prices from other countries they don't also have to match the quality of what you're offered in other countries. We see this again and again, where the prices are high, the appearance is of some standards but the end quality is just bad. Hotels in Portugal really need to upgrade their game and get educated in what customers need for a quality vacation.

This was bad quality in a gorgeous building that we enjoyed, albeit the rooms could also use a bit of sprucing up, like cleaning the curtains and putting trash bins/bags in the rooms. We will be looking at other options whenever we visit beautiful Esposende. I hope the rest of the hotels offer better experiences.",8 months ago,2

Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Hotel Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel,Mikhail Goussarov,"Friendly Staff and Convenient Location, but Some Drawbacks

The staff here is extremely friendly and always ready to help. When we arrived, the AC wasn't working, but it was promptly fixed the next morning while we were having breakfast.

The included breakfast, however, could use some improvement. It’s the same every day and offers limited options for those who don't consume animal products. On the plus side, we were allowed to bring our own food alternatives, which was appreciated. Breakfast hours are from 7:00 to 10:30, which is quite convenient.

The location is great if you're traveling with kids and want easy access to the sea or the pool. There's plenty of space around the outdoor pool for children to play. However, be aware that some rooms don't have balconies, so drying wet clothes can be a bit tricky—you might need to improvise in your room.

The rooms are clean, and you can request extra towels, sheets, pillows, etc., at no additional charge, though this is only available in the mornings.

One downside is the lack of lounge spaces suitable for working or taking calls. The room itself isn’t really set up for this either, which could be a challenge if you want to work during your stay. The WiFi is ok:

Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Hotel Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel,gforycka,"The Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel in Povoa de Varzim falls short of its 4-star rating in several key areas.

Positive Aspects

Clean rooms: This is a positive point and suggests a basic level of hygiene is maintained.
Good pool: A pleasant amenity, especially during warmer months.
Excellent spa and massages: A highlight for those seeking relaxation.
Negative Aspects

Below 4-star standards: This is a significant issue as it suggests a discrepancy between the hotel's advertised rating and actual service.
Limited ironing facilities: Only one ironing room for the entire hotel is inconvenient.
No late check-out option: This can be a major drawback for guests with late flights or other plans.
Repetitive breakfast: Lack of variety in the morning meal can be disappointing.
Poor bar service: Long wait times, incorrect orders, and guests opting for external dining are serious issues.
Unengaging entertainment: The described entertainment might not appeal to all guests.

While the hotel has some positive aspects, the overall experience seems to be negatively impacted by several service-related issues. Guests might want to consider alternative accommodations if these factors are important to them.",8 months ago,2

Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Axis Ofir Beach Resort Hotel,R4F4,"What to say about the Axis Ofir Beach Resort Hotel?

I first want to say that this is the 3rd or 4th time we stay at this property, and I really wanted to wait to post a review. The reason I opted to wait is that my rating and review were going to be very low, as we were disappointed with the hotel's condition, room cleanliness, and unacceptable misses during breakfast.
Having said this, I am pleased to post a 5-star review, and not because our stay this time has been perfect, but because of the huge improvements we have seen, and because of how the staff continues to amaze us with their hospitality.
I want to give a special shout out to Milena, a member of the Housekeeping/Public Space team. She was cleaning the floor by the restaurant, there was no member of the staff in the dining room, and there were no bananas or plain yogurt out, so she went above and beyond when we asked her to call someone, and went into the kitchen herself, brought out a couple of bananas for our starving and cranky toddler, and told the F&B team to come help us. This is what hospitality is about. Please give her a raise or something.
Our room was super clean, and the mildew issue has been corrected almost 100%. The room attendants are very nice, clean well, and engage with us in the hallways. They pay attention and clean our room as soon as we leave for breakfast.
The Front Desk staff is great, especially Fabio, if I got his name right, who checked us in, and has always been working during all of our stays, and was the only good one last time we had issues.
The maintenance staff is great too, as one of them helped us with the bathroom sink.
You can really tell how the new director has turned things around (yes, we asked because we could really see an improvement) and a nice initiative was to have Christmas treats and drinks down in the lobby starting on Christmas' Eve.

Great job to everyone! I highly recommend this hotel!",a year ago,5

They gave you cards that you could exchange for a towel at the reception and most of the staff was nice and spoke almost fluently English.

Great things:
We had an amazing time.
The bed is very big and comfy, the shower is great and the room very spacious.
Breakfast is very good, even lactose free options.
We had 2 dinners at the hotel restaurant, in a huge group, and we had a great time.

The room was very clean and big (20 square meters ~ 215 square feets) with private bathrooms. And those beds and pillows... So so comfy!

The host Silvia is amazing, communicative and made sure we had everything we needed. Even after scheduling the check-in for an earlier hour but spending more time in Porto downtown, we were able to self check-in with ease later in the night.

At morning, we were greeted by Silvia's smile and had a clean and healthy breakfast to kickstart the day.

Worth to mention that they have a partnership with a Surf School so I'm pretty sure that Azurara GuestHouse is the best place to stay to surf around the Porto area.

Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Autor GuestHouse,David D'Alessio,"WeHostel would be a better description of these peculiar accommodations.  Rooms are a private stay in what is primarily an office/retail building.  Case in point 1: you’ll check-in at the home furnishings store that occupies the ground level retail space (we also found many of these furnishings -with price tags- in our room…coincidence?). Case in point 2: A worker at the retail store checked us into our room. Case in point 3: there are no staff after 630pm so guests are left to their own devices. Point 4:  Our room was on the same floor as what appeared to be a co-working space wherein the same workers also shared the community kitchen and comfy courtyard.  And Point 5: rooms themselves have paper thin walls- they’re not structured for sound separation.  Thankfully our neighbor only had one late night phone call.
Accommodations are clean. Location is centrally located. Breakfast was nothing special compared to others at this price point. And also if you’re walking, they didn’t start till 8 am which is not especially helpful.
I don’t know how Autor could better give guests an idea of what to expect succinctly, hence this long review. For us, this worked as nice place en route along the Camino. But I left scratching my head about whether Portuguese zoning laws allow for the mix of all these businesses? -What amounts to strangers paying for fancy sleeping quarters an office space-  Or do they???
Might wanna get that elevator fixed guys.",a year ago,3
Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Autor GuestHouse,Clinton Bachelder,"We had a very good stay. The staff was attentive and kind to us. The location was practically on the costal camiho and had a information center right around the corner. The room was modern with a nice bathroom . There was art everywhere, most was for sale, we could not buy any as we were walking but some of it was really good. I should mention the breakfast as it was very good with fresh made bread, good cheeses and spreads and the 2 girls and fella working the room where really on point.,😀",2 years ago,5

It was shared but no one had booked the other room. He also recommended a restaurant which so far is our favourite. Beautiful place, He made us a fabulous breakfast in the morning.

Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Forte de São João Baptista de Vila do Conde,Artur Victoria,"We could not visit the inside because is temporarely closed for repairs. It was initially dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption, but for a long time the only invocation is that of the patron saint of Vila do Conde, St. John the Baptist. Its construction began in the 1570s, referred to as already in progress in the Books of Minutes of the House in 1573, and probably ordered by D. Sebastião, who by missive sent in 1570 to several municipalities made known to his intention to fortify all of Larger coastal places from Cascais to Caminha. The fortress has five Baluartes, called St. Anthony, Santa Barbara (Terra -Terra - This and North), St. Francis, St. John and Our Lady of the Guide (turned to the sea - northwest, southwest and south). Three of the Baluartes have Guaritas, one of which the last to be built, the Santa Barbara, whose termination was reached only in 1793, completing the building of the forte more than two centuries after its beginning. The Fort of St. John the Baptist would have by this date bridge, freshwater well, house and headquarters of the governor, paiol and warehouses of weapons and gunpowder, dungeons, kitchen, fake door, chapel, artillery pieces, among others.",2 years ago,5

The staff was very nice and helpful. They have a nice backyard with a pool, and the dining room was very nice. My main issue with our stay was that we were offered dinner and a massage when we arrived. We agreed to dinner because we were tired from our hike, but we were not told a price. The dinner was a really nice 4 course meal, and then we asked for wine with the meal. After our meal we went to our room to sleep, but there was a knock and we were told to pay over €60 cash for our dinner. Each meal was €25 and the bottle of wine was €14. This is not super expensive, but most meals with wine had cost us €30 when eating out so we were very surprised, especially when our stay at the hotel cost €70. We almost didn't have enough cash for the meal. So again a nice place to stay, but our stay was ruined with the expensive dinner surprise.",2 years ago,3
Póvoa de Varzim,hotel,Villa d'Arcos,Victoria Negrea,"Okay. We had a double bed in a decently sized room. The shower and toilet were directly in the room (not a connecting area), which was odd. The pool was lovely. I felt scammed though as there were no prices for the mini fridge and we were asked multiple times to pay if we had taken anything. The host also said ""dinner is at 7"" implying that dinner was included. We ended up having to pay $60 for dinner and a bottle of wine which was not in our budget.",2 years ago,3

Póvoa de Varzim,praia,Praia do Quião,Alex Haas,"There are many reasons to visit the small town of A Ver-o-Mar near Povoa de Varzim. There's a great restaurant with fantastic views, friendly locals and a breathtaking boardwalk.

And then there's this beach. Even on a weekend in full summer you will find the beach quite empty. Lots of great spots for sunbathing still available. Bring your own gear, since there are no places to rent any chairs and umbrellas. And that's a good thing. It's a very local beach, with people relaxing. Everybody's having a good time and everybody's pretty quiet. Dogs officially not allowed, but many locals brought their pet anyways, which was fun.

The beach is very nice, small dunes in the back. And it's a really clean beach, both the sand and the (cold) water.

Parking along the road right behind the beach is plenty and free (there's more free spaces at the restaurant), but they fill up fast, since many come for biking and walking along the ocean as well.

Santa Maria da Feira,restaurante,Restaurante Amandius,Barry Huang,"Very local restaurant, big portions for a very reasonable price. It's like a dinner style where you can see your food get cooked right in front of your eyes. All the food is fresh, and service was super nice, considering we don't speak Portuguese. The steak was salted well and cooked to a perfect medium rare, sunny side up egg cooked so the yolk was still a little runny, and the amount of fries they served us was insane. They brought out a plate of fries for the table, and I thought it was for the whole table, but they said it was for one person. We didn't even get to finish all the amazing food because of the sheer amount of food. Overall, this is a very true to the blue local restaurant that serves you homecooked food for a very respectable price (Unlike the tourist restaurants in Lisbon that we were in, which some Indian restaurant charged like a whopping 18 dollars for some trash, small portioned seafood rice) But yeah this place has no tourists, which most of the time tells you that the restaurant will be good.

Santa Maria da Feira,restaurante,Lago,Mikhael,"An outstanding culinary experience overall. The design and view were pleasant, and the food was at the expected level, with special notes to the deserts, which were delicious and well presented. Some oddities were the starters of cold cuts already on the table with plastic wrap. Not an issue, just odd. The service was attentive, but they did mix up an order, and the flow of the meals was a bit slow. It’s not the most calming restaurant. Due to the size of the space and the amount of staff, it feels like people are constantly speeding around. One minor improvement is, that they have a display of champagnes at the entrance, that at the time of this review needed someone to clean the dust.",2 years ago,4

Santa Maria da Feira,restaurante,Praceta,P Vieira,"I must say, I cannot recommend this restaurant enough – but only if you’re someone who truly appreciates high-quality dining, cherishes a captivating atmosphere, and respects the environment enough to ensure everyone’s continued enjoyment.

If that sounds like you, then let me share my delightful experience, along with my guests. Our journey began even before we set foot in the restaurant, starting with a seamless phone reservation process. The restaurant is conveniently located, offering multiple access options and ample parking nearby. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a seemingly modest facade, which cleverly conceals the gem of an experience waiting inside.

The welcome we received was warm and genuine, setting the stage for the cozy ambiance that followed. The room temperature was just perfect, the Christmas decorations tasteful and festive, and the music – oh, the music! It was both pleasant and perfectly pitched.

But let’s talk about the food – a culinary marvel! The kitchen team outdid themselves with the quality of the dishes and their meticulous presentation. Even during a busy service, the staff was attentive and caring, showing remarkable dedication to their craft.

In conclusion, kudos to the entire team for creating such a memorable experience. I’m already looking forward to my next visit!",a year ago,5

Bad for the environment, bad in taste. The food was served fast however absolutely a disgrace. The Spaghetti full of oil. The chicken was dry. The pesto without much taste.
My friend ordered pasta with Gambas and it came with Parmesan on top! NEVER put Parmesan on a seafood dish. Basic knowledge in Italian cuisine.
If people like this, leave it optional but don't automatically add it!
The desserts were a joke and had nothing to do with Italian food and not only tasted bad but also were presentesld very poorly.

Santa Maria da Feira,restaurante,Feitoria Rest&Lounge,IC,"We attended the medieval festival tonight and wanting to sit outside and enjoy the nice evening, we chose to come here. The staff seemed friendly, and I noticed they were selling Pernil, which I was really craving. So, I ordered that, which comes with rice and beans. My favorite person ordered the cod with rice and beans, along with chicken gizzards, soup, and two sangrias.

The sangria came in a small cup, and while the gizzards were very small in portion, they tasted good. The soup was just okay. However, when our main meals arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The Pernil was unrecognizable—dry chunks of meat mixed with thin slice that looked like leftovers. Both the meat and the rice were cold.

I was so disappointed. I ate what I could because I was starving, but this was by far the worst meal I’ve had in Portugal in two months. The quality was unacceptable. It was a shameful representation of the restaurant during such a great event.

UPDATE: In response to the owner’s update. Well, isn't this fascinating? The food somehow magically appeared from this restaurant’s kitchen, but the owner—bless their heart—appears to have absolutely no clue about it and insists it wasn’t from their establishment. I mean, who knew food could just wander off and cook itself? Maybe the kitchen has a secret side hustle that even the owner isn’t aware of. Truly, it's a mystery for the ages. Clearly, this place is on the cutting edge of culinary innovation—so cutting edge, even the owner is left in the dark!",8 months ago,1

Santa Maria da Feira,restaurante,YÜJIN Sushi - Santa Maria da Feira,Rian Yan,"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a high-quality sushi restaurant in this town. The menu leans toward a high-end fusion style, featuring premium ingredients like truffle, caviar, wagyu, and toro. It exceeded my expectations.

That said, if I were to be extremely picky, there’s room for minor improvements. The dessert selection could be expanded to match the sophistication of the sushi offerings. The O-toro wasn’t fully defrosted, which slightly affected the texture. Additionally, the waitstaff could benefit from better English proficiency.

Overall, though, the pricing here is significantly more affordable than similar high-end sushi spots in Lisbon, such as Mattë or Yakuza.",2 months ago,5

We were just looking for something on our trip down south and we love sushi, it had good reviews so we stopped by for lunch. I was nervous because it says you need a reservation but, they had tables and showed us to a table. They do not have an English menu so we just got a 16 special piece and the 16 piece of the day. It was definitely the way to go because we got a variety of pieces and they were ALL delicious. Side note, it doesn't come with wasabi or ginger (doesn't mean they do not have it). Our favorite piece was the one with strawberries, it was a delightful combination of flavors that we did not expect. We also ordered the chicken gyoza (not pictured) and it was very good as well. The four pieces were steamed and were on plated on a bamboo steamer (similar to dumplings).

Santa Maria da Feira,restaurante,Massa9va,Victoria Shaw,"I have been a customer of Massanova for many years, but my visit yesterday was an absolute disappointment.

Firstly, our order was messed up, and it resulted in an 8-year-old having to wait an unnecessarily long time for his pizza while everyone else at the table had nearly finished their meals. Although I can appreciate that mistakes do happen, it makes it an unenjoyable experience when a child has to wait so long for their meal.

To add to the frustration, we requested some parmesan cheese for the pasta dishes we ordered. However, upon receiving the bill, we were astonished to find a charge of 4.50€ for three extra ingredients, with two of those charges being specifically for the parmesan cheese.

When we brought up these issues to the waitress, she was dismissive and rude, showing no interest in resolving the situation or addressing our concerns. Even our request for a discount, given the inconvenience caused and the excessive cheese charge, fell on deaf ears. Her lack of professionalism and indifference to customer satisfaction was shocking, to the point that she told us we should have actually been charged more for the cheese as more than two of us ate it!!!!

Speaking with the person who seemed to be in charge that evening yielded nothing but a belated apology. There was no effort to rectify the situation or provide any form of compensation. It was evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for the management.

Unfortunately, this experience has left me questioning whether I will return to the restaurant.

I hope the management takes this review seriously and addresses the issues raised. As a customer, I believe in fair treatment and transparency when it comes to billing practices. Until there are tangible improvements, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this restaurant to others.

Note: My intention with this review is to provide constructive feedback for the betterment of the restaurant. I hope my concerns are taken seriously, and steps are taken to improve the overall dining experience.",a year ago,1

Ticket for students cost only 1 €, the museum lies on hill very close to we'll visible church.

They have break for lunch, probably from 12pm  and reopen around 2pm as I remember!

The whole museum is well exposed, you can ask for audio guide, both in English or Portuguese and it helps a lot, I truly recommend! Firstly you can see history from centuries BCE, Visigoths, Roman Empire influence, stone tool, craved stone monument's and other interesting art.

Then there is nice amount of items from close castle Santa Maria da Feira, which probably will be the reason why most of the people visit the city, so notice that going to museum will explain you a lot about the castle itself!

They explain many things about architecture of castle with informations about which parts were built for which reason and by which king! You can also find well described informations of Fogaça bread history, the city manufactures workshops from later periods (middle age and newer times up to today) with presentation of tools and explanation on importance about it to the city and people living there.

In the last part there is story behind the building in which museum was located which was court after they changed it from convent building, with exposition of modern, but nice looking local art.",a year ago,5

Santa Maria da Feira,hotel,Nova Cruz Hotel,Remus Gabriel,"Definitely not a 4 star hotel! The rooms are not sound proof and you can hear your neighbors in the bathroom while they do bathroom stuff. The sleeping covers are horrendous: they made no effort in giving you a good sleep experience, they just threw some sheets and some blankets and done. In the winter it gets super cold at night and in order to avoid that, you need to make sure you have a super warm room before going to bed or sleep all night with a noisy fan on. Breakfast is poor and lacking variety. The staff is really friendly and the bathrooms are ok. Would not recommend.",5 years ago,2

Santa Maria da Feira,hotel,INATEL Santa Maria da Feira,Antonieta Ponce de Leão,"I’ve choose this hotel because it belongs to a chain of hotels that I trust.

I’ve visited in December, and the pool was closed and not clean.

The room was good on price quality ratio, the bed was ok and I would have had a nice sleep if it wasn’t because of the noise.

I’ve requested a room on the top floor but they only had a room on the second floor.

The noite from pluming, people moving around in the bedrooms etc is deafening… I had to sleep with ear plugs. The ceilings are so high, if they reinforce them with noise cancellation would be very different.

Besides the noise is the hallway is absurd… guests chat in there waking everyone up.

The breakfast had eggs and sausages that was nice, but the machines were turned down, the fresh cuts and cheese looked very old. they had some fresh baked bread! So that with the eggs saved the day ☺️ also they had fresh fruit and that is great.

It is a small buffet, but for the price of the room it was great!

The Wi-Fi doesn’t work on the 2nd floor, and it is not good on the restaurant. But works fine on the lobby.

I would return if I stayed on the top floor and maybe at the Summer or so.

My low rating is just because of the noise. It is really absurd how much you listen to.",3 years ago,3

The location is a bit unfortunate however as it is located right next to a church with a bell that rings every 15 minutes to tell you the time.

Every day spent with room window ajar. Had to sleep with window open to let the crisp air in (fortunately the nights were cool) from outside otherwise the room is just too uncomfortable to sleep- and I live in the tropics lol. Not recommended for light sleeper as sleeping with the window open means hearing the occasional rooster crow and dogs barking in the middle of the night and early morning. The afternoon sun literally bakes the hotel room in the day. Interestingly the lobby and lifts are always well air conditioned.

Dinner was a set menu with no alternative options and the food was mediocre- I would recommend to eat outside River Restaurant is just a short 10min walk and serves great Portuguese roast chicken- I’ve written a Google review about it :)

However, I would give three stars. One for the staff who are lovely ( the guys are all very attentive and responsive), and the second for amenities such as reliable fast wifi and rooms although show signs of wear are well maintained and clean. TV channel choices are abundant and room is well stocked- toilettries, bottled water, range of towels, bath robes, luggage stand, mini fridge with drinks, charging points, etc. Bed and pillows are comfortable.

Kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook and a good size fridge with ice-box, toaster, kettle and microwave. Separate sink to hand wash clothes and rack to dry them on.

Great access to the roads if you want to travel further afield with Porto only 25 mins away. We visited lots of places by car and had a lovely time. Highly recommended this apartment hotel, really great location, clean, fabulous staff and great for families. The only problem was the location of plug sockets in the bedrooms , there was only one in each and they were in strange not accessible places BUT using an extension will solve this.

The sleeping covers are horrendous: they made no effort in giving you a good sleep experience, they just threw some sheets and some blankets and done. In the winter it gets super cold at night and in order to avoid that, you need to make sure you have a super warm room before going to bed or sleep all night with a noisy fan on.

I recently stayed at a lovely hotel in the small town of Espinho, near Porto, Portugal, and had an unforgettable experience. The hotel is located right on the oceanfront, offering breathtaking views of the sea.

A special thanks to the host, Diogo, for his exceptional hospitality. Every day, he brought us delicious pastries from the local bakery, adding a personal and delightful touch to our mornings.

The sunsets over the ocean were simply incredible, creating magical evenings that we will always remember. We are already planning to return many more times.

During the whole visit you are taken care of. Starting from recommendations where it’s better to eat or make shopping and ending with being given a wind shield so that you can feel comfortable at the beach at a windy day.

Everything is very neat and clean and for breakfast you have freshly baked bread every day. The hostel location is also great - 5 minutes from the train station and 5 minutes to the beach and restaurants area. So I highly recommend this place and definitely will come back",2 years ago,5

And you have a commanding view of the countryside.

Explicitly mentioned in the Gothic chronicles, the transformation of the Castle of Santa Maria da Feira into a Marian monument makes it a symbol of Portuguese medieval architecture. Its historical and architectural significance is undeniable, but a visit truly comes to life during the Medieval Fair that takes place in the summer. During this event, the castle and the surrounding town are transformed into a living re-enactment of the Middle Ages, offering visitors a unique opportunity to experience history firsthand.

This annual fair is one of Portugal’s most renowned medieval festivals, where the streets fill with traditional costumes, re-creations of medieval trades, tournaments, and performances, immersing you in the culture and life of centuries past. Whether you are passionate about history, fascinated by architecture, or simply seeking an enchanting experience, the Castle of Santa Maria da Feira provides a captivating visit, especially during this summer celebration.",6 months ago,4

We came today, attracted by the laudatory articles and the result is frankly not what was announced. The water is dirty, full of algae which appears almost rotten, it would be interesting to clean the pool more often. The place is very small and frankly poorly located, the highway passes about 400m away, all in the middle of what looks more like an industrial zone than a pretty beach to relax on. The price is not justified in my opinion, paying 5€ per half day per person just to be able to sit at the water's edge with a really small body of water, it's expensive in my opinion. The place's bar is relatively expensive compared to what is offered (a few salads, as well as tostas mistas).
My only stars go for the extreme kindness of the staff, who were very pleasant and attentive.
It's a shame, the place could be nice, but for this price, it's really not worth it...

Santa Maria da Feira,praia,São Jacinto Beach,Stefan Bostock,"Probably one of the best beaches I’ve ever been to. Vast, wild, and empty (there were around 10 other people visible on the beach in later September). Could have watched the crashing building-sized waves indefinitely. They were so mesmerising that my partner passed out face down on the sand almost immediately. Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

Santa Maria da Feira,praia,Marinha da Noeirinha,Isadora de Oliveira,"I went to the lagoon to swim in the afternoon with my husband. When we arrived, the first thing we did was paying the fee, €10. The receptionist was kind and gave us a bracelet and said with these exact words: you don't have to put it on, but if anyone asks, just show it. Ok, I put it in my pocket and didn't even think it was that important, after all, there were only about 10 people there and no explicit saying that it’s obligatory to use. We spent about 2 hours sunbathing, I noticed some employee looking at us weird and when we were about to leave, an employee yelled at me, extremely rude. Apparently, instead of coming politely to ask: “hey guys, can I see your bracelet” it’s better to make a scene for nothing. If I knew I would put this bracelet in my forehead with flowers to avoid this. Very uncomfortable and unprofessional, not to mention that 10€ is too much for what they were offering.

Need to walk a little bit to get there (less than 10 minutes) and the swim is not easy because of the waves but as it is also windy it feels ok. Good atmosphere, very few people and almost a virgin beach. Men as always are staring at you so maybe if you are a woman going by yourself you wont feel that comfortable. shame on you men, BEHAVE!

Santa Maria da Feira,praia,Praia do São Jacinto,Larissa Dias,"O local é sensacional! Paisagem incrível do contraste das dunas com a floresta de pinheiros e arbustos, o passeio é relaxante e muito espetacular. É preciso pegar o autocarro ""Forte da barra"" que passa na Lourenço peixinho ou então pegar ele na estação rodoviária de Aveiro, descer no ponto Forte da barra (ferry). É preciso pegar a balsa para atravessar o mar. Descendo da balsa é possível seguir o caminho pelo Google maps que aparece se colocar na busca: 'Reserva natural de São Jacinto'. Foi um pouco difícil saber se estávamos no caminho certo, mas seguindo o caminho apontado no GPS você encontra primeiro a placa escrito 'Reserva São Jacinto' e vai reto por muito tempo, até uma hora encontrar um piso de madeira atravessando a estrada, você pode seguir tanto para a direita como pela esquerda, ou continuar reto que você conseguirá achar esse caminho da ponte que leva até a costa e a praia de dunas.
Na minha opinião poderia ter mais placas explicando os caminhos e rotas para chegar lá, pois fomos nos aventurando para chegar no local sem saber ao certo para onde estávamos indo.
É uma caminhada um pouco longa então é apropriado sapatos confortáveis e garrafa de água. O caminho na reserva é todo em solo arenoso, então pode ser que entre bastante areia no seu tênis.
A paisagem ao final da ponte é de outro mundo, vale muito a pena a caminhada. Depois pode se explorar essas outras rotas que existem por lá.",6 years ago,5

I was surprised by the daily meal offer: a wonderful balanced gazpacho for hot days and a succulent mushroom and spinach risotto, all cooked without dairy products and served by friendly staff! The cherry on top is the beautiful space, a traditional building renovated in a minimalist but well thought out way. I was a little sad that I couldn't enjoy any desert as I have a dairy intolerance. Luckily, there is an artisan ice cream shop next door with vegan options. Perfect lunch!",2 years ago,5

Santo Tirso,restaurante,Pizzaria Per Tutti,Daniel SIlver,"We have eaten pizza all over the world, from Naples to New York and we are serious foodies. Imagine our surprise when we stopped into Pizzaria Per Tutti, an unassuming small pizza spot in the small town of Santo Tirso almost by accident and had what had to be some of the best pizza we have EVER had, ANYWHERE. We ordered 3 for three of us because we could not stop eating it. From the fresh arugula piled high to the buffalo mozzarella, to the best prosciutto and parma ham imaginable, to nice thick slices of real Parmesan, a light sprinkling of fresh oregano, a PERFECT crust in a wood-fired oven, this was simply fantastic. I assumed that the owner had been a top chef in Naples and had moved here, but that's not the case. He's Portuguese, a retired pharmacist, and he and his wife and son run this amazing pizza place. They were charming, warm, and obviously know EXACTLY what they are doing. I mean, this was 5 Star Pizza All the Way. Don't miss it!",5 years ago,5

É que por ali muito perto há bem melhor e muito, mas muito, mais bem servido...

Serviço da cozinha muito fraquinho para um restaurante desta gama de preço porque não serviu o wasabi nem gengibre junto com o sushi deixando o cliente 15 min â espera pelo mesmo

Santo Tirso,hotel,Santo Thyrso Hotel,D K,"We checked in and immediately were appalled at the smell our room had. A combination of BO and whatever chemical/cleaning solution they used to try to mask it. The AC was not working properly and opening windows did not help (street view room).

By 8pm on the check-in day we asked the person at the front desk to check out and for a refund. They called the manager and agreed to it, however we were told to cancel through orbitz as we booked through the third party. When we created a ticket to ask for a refund, orbitz customer service said they need to confirm with the manager. After waiting 3 days we got an email saying the Hotel management could not be contacted and did not approve our refund.

This is all in addition to the ongoing renovations on the building while we were supposed to stay there AND the door locks not working. The staff had to go and unlock every guests room with a master key each time you would come back to your room.

I recognize that this is a small town, however, if in the hospitality business customers need to be considered a bit more. This place is out to make money even though their hotel and rooms are not suitable for hosting anyone. I do not recommend this ""hotel"" to anyone staying in Santo Tirso.",a year ago,1

Santo Tirso,hotel,Quinta de Silvalde,Krisztina Gat,"Our stay at Silvalde was disastrous and the worst we’ve experienced. It was the first hotel we’ve ever left early. We’d planned to celebrate my wife’s birthday but regretted it as soon as we arrived. We were “upgraded” to a bungalow, which was dirty with dust, socks left by a previous guest, dirty cups, and a missing safe. The “safe” they brought was laughable—small and portable. The room had multiple issues: worn-out towels, limescale and holes in the shower, one hook only for bathroom towels, broken terrace doors, a faulty fridge, and a poorly equipped kitchenette. The ""heated"" pool was cold, and the spa area had water puddles with electrical cords from lots of dehumidifiers. The lack of basic facilities like trash bins for dog waste was frustrating, and the spa was in a separate building, making it inconvenient in colder weather.

We had also pre-arranged a vegan birthday dinner, but the experience was a mess. The first course was non-vegan, and when the staff realised their mistake, the replacement was a tiny, bland vegetable plate. The main course, barley risotto, lacked the promised “crispy aubergine.” For dessert, they served a non-vegan cake—after promising a vegan one. When I confronted them, they insisted it was a gift, we could look at it, but that we couldn’t eat it. The whole ordeal was humiliating, especially on my wife’s birthday. We immediately informed the ""manager"" at the front desk that we would not be staying the second night.

The next morning, we were charged full price for the dinner (bar a fruit salad we had not asked for), despite the many mistakes, and no one from management apologised, made a gesture to appease us or even acknowledged the issue. We had to book somewhere else at the last minute, which ruined our plans. A manager said we “ate the food, so we had to pay,” even though it was their mistake. The service was abysmal, and we won’t return. Stay away from this hotel—they don’t care about their guests.

Thankfully, our last-minute booking at an organic quinta near Porto was amazing. Even though booked the same afternoon, they went out of their way to accommodate us with a delicious vegan dinner and a surprise cake, which made up for the disaster at Silvalde.",5 months ago,1

Ich habe ein paar Tage nach der Buchung eine Email geschrieben um meine Situation zu erklären, dass ich heiraten werde und ich mich gerne dort in dieser Suite zusammen mit den Brautjungfern am morgen zurecht machen würde. Dafür würde die Stylistin am morgen in die Suite kommen um uns vier zu schminken und zu frisieren. Um ca. 11 Uhr würde noch der Fotograf dazustossen um noch ein paar Fotos in der Suite zu machen und danach würden wir vor dem Mittag das checkout machen und das Hotel wieder verlassen um in die Kirche zu gehen.
Auf meine Email haben sie mir nur geantwortet, dass dies nicht möglich ist dass die Stylistin und der Fotograf in die Suite kommen (ohne Begründung). Ich habe dann nach dem Grund gefragt und er hat gesagt, wegen den anderen Gästen und sie hätten an diesem Tag eine Braut die dort heiraten wird.
Ich war sehr enttäuscht weil ich habe extra eine Suite gebucht wegen dem Platz, habe sie vorgängig informiert und das Hotel wäre von der Lage her optimal gewesen. Die Suite war ja nicht besetzt und ich hatte schon gebucht, sie stand also noch zur Verfügung unabhängislg von der anderen Hochzeit. Ausserdem hätte ich weder das andere Brautpaar noch die anderen Gäste gestört, wüsste nicht wie.
Und warum darf man sich nicht dort in einer Suite die man bezahlt zurecht machen nur weil noch eine andere Braut im gleichen Hotel ist?
Ich verstehe es nicht! Nur weil ich nicht dort mein Hochzeitsfest feiere darf ich keine Suite buchen um mich zurecht zu machen? Und warum darf die Stylistin am morgen nicht dazustossen? Komisch!

Very bad cleaning in the house, especially the kitchen, where all cupboards had a specific smell once you opened them, and the  interior of the fridge and sink  were not clean when we arrived.  Moreover, there was no soap and shower gel in some bathrooms, and only 1 piece of toilet paper per room in check in.  The pillow cases smelled frol the pillows which were full of dust, and my hair smelled after sleeping on those pillows:(. The property was all rented for our group, and we have received only 1 key, which needed to be shared( the entrance area had a digital acces point which was broken and could not be used).

São João da Madeira,restaurante,Yokoi Sushi,Moheb,One of the best sushi I have ever ate. Friendly staff. Cosy atmosphere.,9 months ago,5
São João da Madeira,restaurante,Yokoi Sushi,Lilia Sunshine,"Yokoi in São João da Madeira is a solid choice if you're craving sushi. The variety of rolls and fresh ingredients make it a nice place for anyone who enjoys Japanese cuisine. The atmosphere is cozy, but the interior is not very exciting, and there aren’t many tables, so they are placed quite close to each other.
On the plus side, the bathroom is clean, and they offer a convenient take-away option if you prefer to enjoy your meal at home. While it might not be the most extravagant sushi spot, it’s a reliable place for a delicious meal. The prices are fair, and they offer a great selection, making it a good option for lunch or dinner.
However, I would personally skip the plastic flowers on the sushi trays – they don’t really add to the experience. Also, serving plates with chipped edges gives an impression of a lack of attention to detail, which can affect the overall impression of the place. Definitely worth trying if you’re in the area, but there's room for improvement.",a month ago,4

Before anything else, she offered to explain how the all-you-can eat menu works.
The selection of every imaginable type of sushi was beyond belief, and everything I tried was delicious. There must have been 80 - 100 different menu items to choose from, and they just kept coming and coming and coming….

The food was delicious, but when you've been waiting for an hour you no longer enjoy it.

São João da Madeira,restaurante,Restaurante Segredo Brasonado,Emanuel Silva,"Fantástico. Um cântico acolhedor, com uma picanha maravilhosa
Comecei por comer um Caldo Verde, recomendado pelo chefe. Um sabor diferente de todos os caldos que comi em restaurantes, o que mais diferenciava era a chouriça defumada caseira, notava-se mesmo que era caseira e dava outro paladar ao caldo
De seguida decidir comer a Picanha algo como já disse em cima, paladar fantástico, carne fresca e com um sabor ao tempero algo que eu pessoalmente gosto
No fim sugerido pelo chefe, um bolo de chocolate da casa. Enfim não tenho palavras para descrever o gosto e o sabor daquele doce.

São João da Madeira,restaurante,Restaurante Sabores Wok,Lilia Sunshine,"Sabores Wok could be a good spot with its wide selection of food, but unfortunately, the hygiene standards here are questionable. I’ve heard from others that they had stomach issues after visiting, and I personally have no desire to return after a couple of visits. While the food variety isn’t bad, the lack of proper cleanliness left a bad impression. It’s disappointing because the potential for a great experience is there, but hygiene concerns are a big issue for me. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a safer dining experience.",a month ago,3
São João da Madeira,restaurante,Restaurante Sabores Wok,Fritz Finkenstein,"Sushi seemed great. Nice-sizes pieces, not overloaded with rice, some red rice, good variety.

Buffet pretty good though not replenished frequently enough.

BUT my one major concern--and it's a serious one--is with food handling/safety at the grill. Contrary to most health regulations their process is this: customer gets raw food (shellfish, meats, seafood, vegetables, etc) and brings it to the grill. A numbered clip is placed on the plate identifying customer's table. Short order chef takes the food from the plate, cooks it, and then PUTS THE COOKED FOOD BACK ON THE SAME PLATE THAT CONTAINED THE RAW INGREDIENTS. This is, of course, a recipe for disaster. Bacteria on the raw foods that should be killed at cooking is of course reintroduced to the cooked food and then consumed by the customer.

Several hours after today's lunch I'm sitting on the toilet sick from the food. And I even waited at the grill to ensure the cooked food would be placed on a fresh plate.

Clearly there are issues with their food handling and food safety protocols. Not recommended until they resolve these.

Service was great from the Nepali gentleman.",a year ago,1

São João da Madeira,restaurante,Restaurante Sabores Wok,Jean-Manuel Bock,"I don’t like leaving bad reviews, but I also feel I should share our experience.

The food was just shy of the usual average for a buffet and that’s the best I can say about this place. The waitresses argued at our table when placing us, but I can let that slide. When we asked about a particular food item present at the buffet, the staff couldn’t tell me what is was (I’m not sure if that’s worst than my not being able to figure it out on my own). It’s the type of place that attracts big groups, including famillies with their sometimes loud babies, so keep that in mind (not putting that on the restaurant).

I wouldn’t have left a review had it not been for the bad case of indigestion my wife and I had to battle. We both had to hurry out of the car when we got home.

A few notes  -  you can't wander around by yourself, the guided tours are every hour on the hour. No photography was allowed. It was only two of us on the tour and we were not rushed, so it was fine.

São João da Madeira,museu,Museu Convento dos Loios,Wielkopolanin,"*TIP* Go to the museum before visiting castle!!!

Ticket for students cost only 1 €, the museum lies on hill very close to we'll visible church.

They have break for lunch, probably from 12pm  and reopen around 2pm as I remember!

The whole museum is well exposed, you can ask for audio guide, both in English or Portuguese and it helps a lot, I truly recommend! Firstly you can see history from centuries BCE, Visigoths, Roman Empire influence, stone tool, craved stone monument's and other interesting art.

Then there is nice amount of items from close castle Santa Maria da Feira, which probably will be the reason why most of the people visit the city, so notice that going to museum will explain you a lot about the castle itself!

They explain many things about architecture of castle with informations about which parts were built for which reason and by which king! You can also find well described informations of Fogaça bread history, the city manufactures workshops from later periods (middle age and newer times up to today) with presentation of tools and explanation on importance about it to the city and people living there.

In the last part there is story behind the building in which museum was located which was court after they changed it from convent building, with exposition of modern, but nice looking local art.",a year ago,5

São João da Madeira,hotel,Golden Tulip São João da Madeira,daezjn,"Nice looking hotel but lacked convenience and comfort. Air conditioning never worked although promised will be fixed. Every day spent with room window ajar. Had to sleep with window open to let the crisp air in (fortunately the nights were cool) from outside otherwise the room is just too uncomfortable to sleep- and I live in the tropics lol. Not recommended for light sleeper as sleeping with the window open means hearing the occasional rooster crow and dogs barking in the middle of the night and early morning. The afternoon sun literally bakes the hotel room in the day. Interestingly the lobby and lifts are always well air conditioned.

Dinner was a set menu with no alternative options and the food was mediocre- I would recommend to eat outside River Restaurant is just a short 10min walk and serves great Portuguese roast chicken- I’ve written a Google review about it :)

However, I would give three stars. One for the staff who are lovely ( the guys are all very attentive and responsive), and the second for amenities such as reliable fast wifi and rooms although show signs of wear are well maintained and clean. TV channel choices are abundant and room is well stocked- toilettries, bottled water, range of towels, bath robes, luggage stand, mini fridge with drinks, charging points, etc. Bed and pillows are comfortable.

Was here for a business trip with colleagues and noticed quite a few other business guests staying here too.

São João da Madeira,hotel,VistaFreita,Monika F.,"Miałam przyjemność spędzić kilka dni w VistaFreita, i poznać włascicieli Macário i Anabelę, i mogę z całego serca polecić to miejsce każdemu, kto szuka komfortowego i przytulnego noclegu.

Pokoje pięknie urządzone, co sprawiło, że poczułam się jak w domu. Wnętrze było schludne, czyste i starannie wyposażone we wszystkie niezbędne udogodnienia. Kuchnia była doskonale zaopatrzona, co umożliwiło mi swobodne przygotowywanie posiłków.

Lokalizacja VistaFreita jest znakomita – blisko do lokalnych atrakcji, ale jednocześnie zapewnia spokój i ciszę, idealne do relaksu po dniu pełnym zwiedzania. Widoki z okien były po prostu oszałamiające i dostarczały niezapomnianych chwili.
Po sąsiedzku mały kościółek, który przypomina nam co kwadrans, która godzina. To było fantastyczne i w ogóle nie zaburzało ciszy, takie krótkie bicie dzwonów to folklor lokalny który dodaje niepowtarzalnego charakteru temu miejscu. Czułam się tam naprawdę dobrze, jakby czas zwolnił...

Pan Macário i pani Anabela to prawdziwe perełki w świecie gospodarzy. Ich gościnność, troska o szczegóły i chęć pomocy sprawiły, że mój pobyt był jeszcze bardziej przyjemny. Zawsze służyli radą i byli dostępni, by odpowiedzieć na moje pytania.

Ogólnie rzecz biorąc zdecydowanie polecam to miejsce każdemu, kto planuje wizytę w tej okolicy. Być może wrócę tam przy okazji kolejnych podróży!

Then I would recommend to pay a bit more and go to a better place.
The breakfast is also very very simple (almost disappointing) and the room isn't that comfortable... As soon as I finish my meal I left because the space wasn't inviting or confy.
Last but not least the bedroom's bathroom is very small... Which is far from ideal (at least to me).

Kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook and a good size fridge with ice-box, toaster, kettle and microwave. Separate sink to hand wash clothes and rack to dry them on. Really clean and towels/kitchen equipment provided. Espinho is a lovely town with lots of restaurants and coffee shops plus the casino and bars. The beach is fantastic , clean and great for surfing/walking/football/volleyball or just chilling with a book. The cycle path runs all the way to Porto. Great access to the roads if you want to travel further afield with Porto only 25 mins away. We visited lots of places by car and had a lovely time. Highly recommended this apartment hotel, really great location, clean, fabulous staff and great for families. The only problem was the location of plug sockets in the bedrooms , there was only one in each and they were in strange not accessible places BUT using an extension will solve this.

I’ve visited in December, and the pool was closed and not clean.

The room was good on price quality ratio, the bed was ok and I would have had a nice sleep if it wasn’t because of the noise.

I’ve requested a room on the top floor but they only had a room on the second floor.

The noite from pluming, people moving around in the bedrooms etc is deafening… I had to sleep with ear plugs. The ceilings are so high, if they reinforce them with noise cancellation would be very different.

Besides the noise is the hallway is absurd… guests chat in there waking everyone up.

The breakfast had eggs and sausages that was nice, but the machines were turned down, the fresh cuts and cheese looked very old. they had some fresh baked bread! So that with the eggs saved the day ☺️ also they had fresh fruit and that is great.

It is a small buffet, but for the price of the room it was great!

The Wi-Fi doesn’t work on the 2nd floor, and it is not good on the restaurant. But works fine on the lobby.

I would return if I stayed on the top floor and maybe at the Summer or so.

There is an underground car park. If you are driving anything larger than a skateboard you will find it rather tight. Our rental car - a medium sized Citroen C4 - required quite a few back and forth shunts to squeeze between the pillars at the end of each parking space, and the steep spiral slope to get in and out of the car park requires care.

He stocks up the fridge with beer and cola and wine for a Euro a pop. Think the meal was €5 and the bed €16 and that includes bedding with a duvet and a towel.

The sleeping covers are horrendous: they made no effort in giving you a good sleep experience, they just threw some sheets and some blankets and done. In the winter it gets super cold at night and in order to avoid that, you need to make sure you have a super warm room before going to bed or sleep all night with a noisy fan on. Breakfast is poor and lacking variety. The staff is really friendly and the bathrooms are ok. Would not recommend.",5 years ago,2
São João da Madeira,hotel,Nova Cruz Hotel,alexandru luta,"Pro: very cozy, nice and helpful staff, from the receptionist to the cleaning lady, quiet location

Cons: it's more of a 3 stars hotel rather than 4 as they say. The breakfast is pretty dull, no options. The card to the rooms don't quite work, you have to try like 4-5 times, not only to our room, we saw other guests have the same problem. Minibar is very minimal",6 years ago,4

Fresh sea air through windows and doors and lovely scented sticks and candles gave the place a very cared for and welcome vibe. Great local restaurants around, easy walk to both train stations and only a block from the beach.

São João da Madeira,praia,Praia das Dunas de São Jacinto,Larissa Dias,"O local é sensacional! Paisagem incrível do contraste das dunas com a floresta de pinheiros e arbustos, o passeio é relaxante e muito espetacular. É preciso pegar o autocarro ""Forte da barra"" que passa na Lourenço peixinho ou então pegar ele na estação rodoviária de Aveiro, descer no ponto Forte da barra (ferry). É preciso pegar a balsa para atravessar o mar. Descendo da balsa é possível seguir o caminho pelo Google maps que aparece se colocar na busca: 'Reserva natural de São Jacinto'. Foi um pouco difícil saber se estávamos no caminho certo, mas seguindo o caminho apontado no GPS você encontra primeiro a placa escrito 'Reserva São Jacinto' e vai reto por muito tempo, até uma hora encontrar um piso de madeira atravessando a estrada, você pode seguir tanto para a direita como pela esquerda, ou continuar reto que você conseguirá achar esse caminho da ponte que leva até a costa e a praia de dunas.
Na minha opinião poderia ter mais placas explicando os caminhos e rotas para chegar lá, pois fomos nos aventurando para chegar no local sem saber ao certo para onde estávamos indo.
É uma caminhada um pouco longa então é apropriado sapatos confortáveis e garrafa de água. O caminho na reserva é todo em solo arenoso, então pode ser que entre bastante areia no seu tênis.
A paisagem ao final da ponte é de outro mundo, vale muito a pena a caminhada. Depois pode se explorar essas outras rotas que existem por lá.",6 years ago,5

São João da Madeira,praia,São Jacinto Beach,Stefan Bostock,"Probably one of the best beaches I’ve ever been to. Vast, wild, and empty (there were around 10 other people visible on the beach in later September). Could have watched the crashing building-sized waves indefinitely. They were so mesmerising that my partner passed out face down on the sand almost immediately. Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

São João da Madeira,praia,Piscina Municipal,Lilia Sunshine,"Piscina Municipal São João da Madeira has potential but also some areas that need attention. The indoor pools often face maintenance issues, sometimes causing swimming classes for kids to be canceled due to water or installation problems, which can be frustrating for families. The pools themselves are in need of a major renovation to improve the overall experience.

The outdoor pool can get very crowded during peak times, and although the green area is spacious, there’s not enough shade to stay cool on sunny days. Additionally, the outdoor pool showers have cold water, which isn't ideal.

While the pool offers swimming classes and is generally clean, it would benefit from better maintenance and infrastructure to make the experience more enjoyable. It's a decent option, but there's room for improvement.",a week ago,3

São João da Madeira,praia,Golden Tulip São João da Madeira,daezjn,"Nice looking hotel but lacked convenience and comfort. Air conditioning never worked although promised will be fixed. Every day spent with room window ajar. Had to sleep with window open to let the crisp air in (fortunately the nights were cool) from outside otherwise the room is just too uncomfortable to sleep- and I live in the tropics lol. Not recommended for light sleeper as sleeping with the window open means hearing the occasional rooster crow and dogs barking in the middle of the night and early morning. The afternoon sun literally bakes the hotel room in the day. Interestingly the lobby and lifts are always well air conditioned.

Dinner was a set menu with no alternative options and the food was mediocre- I would recommend to eat outside River Restaurant is just a short 10min walk and serves great Portuguese roast chicken- I’ve written a Google review about it :)

However, I would give three stars. One for the staff who are lovely ( the guys are all very attentive and responsive), and the second for amenities such as reliable fast wifi and rooms although show signs of wear are well maintained and clean. TV channel choices are abundant and room is well stocked- toilettries, bottled water, range of towels, bath robes, luggage stand, mini fridge with drinks, charging points, etc. Bed and pillows are comfortable.

São João da Madeira,praia,Praia do São Jacinto,Stefan Bostock,"Probably one of the best beaches I’ve ever been to. Vast, wild, and empty (there were around 10 other people visible on the beach in later September). Could have watched the crashing building-sized waves indefinitely. They were so mesmerising that my partner passed out face down on the sand almost immediately. Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

Very affordable price, for those looking for a good place without traffic and chaos.  Inside they have a bar area, you can come in and drink without buying a ticket.  There is a small parking place.  The road, which is very important, must follow the small dirt road in front of the floating bar, this road has no asphalt. Unknown place even for the residents of aveiro.",a year ago,5

São João da Madeira,praia,Praia Artificial de Aveiro - Urban Beach,Anthéa Bernabeu,"I don't recommend it at all.
We came today, attracted by the laudatory articles and the result is frankly not what was announced. The water is dirty, full of algae which appears almost rotten, it would be interesting to clean the pool more often. The place is very small and frankly poorly located, the highway passes about 400m away, all in the middle of what looks more like an industrial zone than a pretty beach to relax on. The price is not justified in my opinion, paying 5€ per half day per person just to be able to sit at the water's edge with a really small body of water, it's expensive in my opinion. The place's bar is relatively expensive compared to what is offered (a few salads, as well as tostas mistas).
My only stars go for the extreme kindness of the staff, who were very pleasant and attentive.
It's a shame, the place could be nice, but for this price, it's really not worth it...
In short, go your way",10 months ago,2

São João da Madeira,praia,Praia de Bocamar,Aaron Wileman,"Nice wild beach with a rugged beauty and a nearby restaurant. It can be a beach that can be quite dangerous, but it is patrolled by a lifesaver, although his true attention to life saving is questionable. In our visit, it was rough and very dangerous with a strong riptide running right from the middle of the beach (check the photo), which was exactly where he had placed the safety flags for swimming. Additionally, he had moved his own station further up the beach and was playing cards with some friends, paying no attention to the young children at the waters edge, between his dangerously placed flags. Be careful at this beach and I would recommend only swimming when it is truly calm and safe.",4 years ago,3

(se os pedidos iam demorar tanto, não deviam ter entregado logo o cardápio e dar-nos tempo de pedir?). Pedimos cachorros e um prego mal passado. Nunca esperei tanto tempo para pedir. Insistimos para nos servir pelo menos a comida da criança e assim foi. Nós adultos só começamos a almoçar às 14h30. Perguntamos porque estava tão atrasado e em momento algum pediram desculpa. É certo que estava cheio, mas houve pessoas que chegaram depois de nós e começaram a comer antes de nós. Pareceu-me haver muita falta de organização. O prego veio bem passado, alertamos também para essa situação e nem falaram nada. Não sei se é sempre assim, mas espero que não.",2 weeks ago,3

Trofa,museu,Antiga Estação Ferroviária da Trofa - Posto de Turismo,João Jaques,"A Estação Ferroviária da Trofa foi inaugurada em 1875, aquando da abertura do primeiro troço da Linha do Minho que ligava o Porto a Braga em bitola ibérica (via larga). Em 1883 foi aqui instalado o primeiro troço da Linha de Guimarães que unia a Trofa a Vizela em bitola métrica, conhecida como via estreita. À época, entre a Trofa e Lousado, esta linha era algaliada na via larga.
A chegada do caminho-de-ferro a São Martinho de Bougado foi preponderante para o desenvolvimento da localidade e trouxe um novo topónimo: Trofa. As indústrias de transformação de madeiras, moagens, metalomecânica e têxtil que aqui se estabeleceram, a partir dos inícios do século XX, laboravam em função do serviço de despachos das companhias ferroviárias. Para o efeito, foram construídos um armazém e um cais de carga com guindaste. Algumas das empresas, situadas nas imediações da estação, possuíam pequenos terminais privados, ligados às linhas, destinados à carga e descarga de vagões de mercadorias.
Esta estação encerrou em 2010, aquando da inauguração da variante da Trofa e da nova estação.
Com a implementação do projeto de reabilitação e refuncionalização das instalações da Antiga Estação Ferroviária da Trofa, este espaço foi novamente aberto ao público, a 18 de agosto de 2018, com a exposição "" Memória e Identidade da Estação da Trofa"". Esta exposição retrata a relação existente entre a chegada dos caminhos-de-ferro a São Martinho de Bougado, em 1875, e o desenvolvimento do núcleo industrial e populacional que veio a ser a cidade, e depois concelho da Trofa.",3 years ago,5

Trofa,hotel,Santana Hotel & Spa,Lauana Ribeiro Santos,"Bad things:
The hotel should be pet friendly, since nowadays it is very common that people travel with dogs.
I find absolutely unnecessary to use cap in the pool, and the hotel makes it mandatory (and charges 10 Euro for it, in case you don´t own one).

Great things:
We had an amazing time.
The bed is very big and comfy, the shower is great and the room very spacious.
Breakfast is very good, even lactose free options.
We had 2 dinners at the hotel restaurant, in a huge group, and we had a great time.
Last, but not least, the support I got for my wedding was fantastic. They provided me a huge conference from for me, my family and friends to get ready, walked with the staff I hired until the place and brought me everything I needed very fast, kindly and efficiently!

It's a quite place with great breakfast and clean rooms.

The downside for some people could be that its a little off the action. Porto is a 25 min drive and pretty much everything else is a 5-7 min drive. A rental car makes life easier, but other then that, we will come back.

We have seen many hotels in Portugal which cost even half of this ex-Estalagem from 1975 (or so?): low value of high price (around 100-150€/night). Everything is worn in this place, before pandemic such places charged 45-50€ which says all.

Trofa,hotel,Senhor Dos Perdoes Alojamento Local,Vivi Olmedo,"We visited Portugal during Easter 2023. The location of the place is fine if you travel by car, in relation to the price it is not bad at all; The rooms are very spacious and have their own bathroom, in ours everything worked very well, they have a small television, I won't add photos because there are quite a few, they have a closet and are adapted for the disabled, the mattresses and pillows are very comfortable, they have a mini refrigerator that was very useful for us, it also has air conditioning, we didn't use it because the weather was warm when we stayed.
About the area we were greatly surprised that they had a lot of shopping areas, they have a Mercadona and a Lidl very close, they also have cafes (which is appreciated because there are none there in the hotel if you don't reserve it as such before traveling). There are restaurants nearby with typical food, there was also a large store called Continente and they are open every day, we thought they were not open on holidays and we found it open on Good Friday.
The accommodation was pleasant because we only used it to sleep.
As a recommendation if you travel by car and do not like paying tolls, and you travel to nearby cities like Porto or Braga, you have to plan the trip on GPS with the ""No tolls"" option because although it is not expensive from Porto to the hotel: €1.10 they charge you for each way and the hotel is in another district. It is about 40 minutes slow by highway and paying, by national about an hour without toll. To keep in mind if you travel on a very tight budget. The area is very quiet and they have their own large parking lot. They cleaned the rooms every day we stayed, I have nothing to add about the cleaning, you couldn't hear anything around as it was on the road we thought it would be very noisy but the windows had electric blinds and were of good quality. In general I recommend it to go with family. The receptionist's attention has been good.",2 years ago,4

Things that require some attention, on my friends room I found some mold. A little maintenance will be nice.

This was clearly an attempt to extort a tip.

The air conditioning in the room didn't work in the hot temp and after complaining to the reception they provided a portable heater. They dealt with it as if it were a recurring problem, given the promptness of the situation and the fact that they didn't check anything else.

Trofa,hotel,Villa C Boutique Hotel,Elric Legloire,"Mixed Experience at Villa C Boutique Hotel

Pros:

- Friendly and responsive staff
- Comfortable beds ensuring a good night's sleep
- Excellent location

Cons:

- Outdated and poorly maintained rooms
- Persistent humidity smell
- Thin walls allowing noise from neighboring rooms
- Subpar breakfast with instant coffee and seemingly store-bought items

While the staff at this hotel is courteous and quick to assist, the overall experience left much to be desired. The comfortable beds and prime location are definite highlights. However, the rooms desperately need renovation, suffering from poor maintenance and a constant humidity odor. The lack of soundproofing between rooms is also a significant issue.

The breakfast was disappointing, with instant coffee and food items that appeared to be directly from a supermarket, not meeting the standards expected at this price point.

Considering the combination of positive and negative aspects, I believe this hotel is overpriced for the quality of experience it currently offers. With some updates and improvements, particularly to the rooms and breakfast service, it could better justify its rate and provide a more satisfying stay.",8 months ago,3

Trofa,hotel,Hotel Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel,Mikhail Goussarov,"Friendly Staff and Convenient Location, but Some Drawbacks

The staff here is extremely friendly and always ready to help. When we arrived, the AC wasn't working, but it was promptly fixed the next morning while we were having breakfast.

The included breakfast, however, could use some improvement. It’s the same every day and offers limited options for those who don't consume animal products. On the plus side, we were allowed to bring our own food alternatives, which was appreciated. Breakfast hours are from 7:00 to 10:30, which is quite convenient.

The location is great if you're traveling with kids and want easy access to the sea or the pool. There's plenty of space around the outdoor pool for children to play. However, be aware that some rooms don't have balconies, so drying wet clothes can be a bit tricky—you might need to improvise in your room.

The rooms are clean, and you can request extra towels, sheets, pillows, etc., at no additional charge, though this is only available in the mornings.

One downside is the lack of lounge spaces suitable for working or taking calls. The room itself isn’t really set up for this either, which could be a challenge if you want to work during your stay. The WiFi is ok:

Trofa,hotel,Hotel Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel,gforycka,"The Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel in Povoa de Varzim falls short of its 4-star rating in several key areas.

Positive Aspects

Clean rooms: This is a positive point and suggests a basic level of hygiene is maintained.
Good pool: A pleasant amenity, especially during warmer months.
Excellent spa and massages: A highlight for those seeking relaxation.
Negative Aspects

Below 4-star standards: This is a significant issue as it suggests a discrepancy between the hotel's advertised rating and actual service.
Limited ironing facilities: Only one ironing room for the entire hotel is inconvenient.
No late check-out option: This can be a major drawback for guests with late flights or other plans.
Repetitive breakfast: Lack of variety in the morning meal can be disappointing.
Poor bar service: Long wait times, incorrect orders, and guests opting for external dining are serious issues.
Unengaging entertainment: The described entertainment might not appeal to all guests.
Overall Impression

While the hotel has some positive aspects, the overall experience seems to be negatively impacted by several service-related issues. Guests might want to consider alternative accommodations if these factors are important to them.",8 months ago,2

Trofa,hotel,Quinta de Silvalde,Krisztina Gat,"Our stay at Silvalde was disastrous and the worst we’ve experienced. It was the first hotel we’ve ever left early. We’d planned to celebrate my wife’s birthday but regretted it as soon as we arrived. We were “upgraded” to a bungalow, which was dirty with dust, socks left by a previous guest, dirty cups, and a missing safe. The “safe” they brought was laughable—small and portable. The room had multiple issues: worn-out towels, limescale and holes in the shower, one hook only for bathroom towels, broken terrace doors, a faulty fridge, and a poorly equipped kitchenette. The ""heated"" pool was cold, and the spa area had water puddles with electrical cords from lots of dehumidifiers. The lack of basic facilities like trash bins for dog waste was frustrating, and the spa was in a separate building, making it inconvenient in colder weather.

We had also pre-arranged a vegan birthday dinner, but the experience was a mess. The first course was non-vegan, and when the staff realised their mistake, the replacement was a tiny, bland vegetable plate. The main course, barley risotto, lacked the promised “crispy aubergine.” For dessert, they served a non-vegan cake—after promising a vegan one. When I confronted them, they insisted it was a gift, we could look at it, but that we couldn’t eat it. The whole ordeal was humiliating, especially on my wife’s birthday. We immediately informed the ""manager"" at the front desk that we would not be staying the second night.

The next morning, we were charged full price for the dinner (bar a fruit salad we had not asked for), despite the many mistakes, and no one from management apologised, made a gesture to appease us or even acknowledged the issue. We had to book somewhere else at the last minute, which ruined our plans. A manager said we “ate the food, so we had to pay,” even though it was their mistake. The service was abysmal, and we won’t return. Stay away from this hotel—they don’t care about their guests.

Thankfully, our last-minute booking at an organic quinta near Porto was amazing. Even though booked the same afternoon, they went out of their way to accommodate us with a delicious vegan dinner and a surprise cake, which made up for the disaster at Silvalde.",5 months ago,1

Trofa,hotel,Santo Thyrso Hotel,D K,"We checked in and immediately were appalled at the smell our room had. A combination of BO and whatever chemical/cleaning solution they used to try to mask it. The AC was not working properly and opening windows did not help (street view room).

By 8pm on the check-in day we asked the person at the front desk to check out and for a refund. They called the manager and agreed to it, however we were told to cancel through orbitz as we booked through the third party. When we created a ticket to ask for a refund, orbitz customer service said they need to confirm with the manager. After waiting 3 days we got an email saying the Hotel management could not be contacted and did not approve our refund.

This is all in addition to the ongoing renovations on the building while we were supposed to stay there AND the door locks not working. The staff had to go and unlock every guests room with a master key each time you would come back to your room.

I recognize that this is a small town, however, if in the hospitality business customers need to be considered a bit more. This place is out to make money even though their hotel and rooms are not suitable for hosting anyone. I do not recommend this ""hotel"" to anyone staying in Santo Tirso.",a year ago,1

My son had a relaxing massage, while my wife and I enjoyed a scenic 3.5-mile trail run through the nearby eucalyptus forest. Walking through the property grounds and vineyard was a treat for the entire family.

The dining experience was truly unforgettable. For the first time, I tried Ox Cheek as a main course, and it was exquisite—so tender and flavorful. We also shared Wild Boar as an appetizer, prepared as a meat pie with a rich chestnut cream that was absolutely delicious. The desserts were equally special, especially one made with passionfruit that really popped with vibrant flavor. I’ve shared photos of some of the incredible dishes we enjoyed.

What truly set this experience apart, however, was the extraordinary care and attention from the staff. During our stay, a train strike disrupted both our arrival and return to Lisbon. The team went above and beyond to ensure we were taken care of. They identified which trains would run on time, arranged transportation to and from the property, prepared lunches for our return trip, and even offered to purchase tickets on our behalf. Every interaction was met with a genuine smile and a “let’s make this work” attitude that made us feel incredibly well cared for.

Solar de Vila Meã is not just a beautiful place to stay—it’s a haven of hospitality. We can’t recommend it highly enough and look forward to returning someday!",4 months ago,5
Trofa,hotel,Solar de Vila Meã,PHILIP HINDLEY,An incredibly beautiful hotel. This is a very special luxury hotel and we have had the most wonderful and relaxing stay. Everything is immaculate and the design is superb. Staff were attentive and friendly and really looked after us to ensure we had a most enjoyable stay - from the wonderful greeting at reception with a tour of the historic main building to the impeccable service in the wonderful restaurant. This hotel attains the highest standards. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant last night and the restaurant alone is worthy of a visit to this hotel - excellent in every respect (superb cuisine and excellent service). I cannot praise this hotel enough - well done and thank you to the owners and the team for creating a totally fabulous hotel. Highly recommended.,8 months ago,5
Trofa,hotel,Solar de Vila Meã,Manuel Veiga,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have been. Placed in the a very pleasant location and a nice view.

Trofa,hotel,Solar de Vila Meã,Guy Cowan,We’ve just spent two incredibly relaxing nights at this beautiful hotel. It only took 40 minutes to drive there from Porto. The hotel is surrounded by vineyards and is newly renovated. The old house is especially beautiful. The rooms here are super-romantic! The food was excellent with tasty local cuisine presented very nicely. They have a really nice wine list too! Our room was huge and our balcony overlooked the vineyards and the hills in the distance. The staff are very friendly and speak excellent English. This is exactly the hotel you need to visit to enjoy the real Portugal. Top notch!,a year ago,5
Trofa,hotel,Hotel Douro,João Dias,"It was overall a lovely experience. The staff is nice, the breakfast is very good, and the rooms have a killer view, as does the hotel in general. The downside for us was they were having construction jobs and it interfered with the peacefulness vibe of the place and the inside pool was quite cold, although they wrote 29° on the board. Apart from that, everything was great!",2 months ago,4
Trofa,hotel,Hotel Douro,FAITH MUKAMI,"Saw the hotel advertises on  Odisseias and bought a voucher. I reached out to the hotel on mail and they confirmed there was availability on my desired date. When I tried to book jand use my voucher they told me I cannot use my voucher from Odisseias.

I spoke to a lady Catia who was dismissive and hang up on me when I was trying to get information and stopped responding to my emails when I inquired on why I couldn't book the hotel.

It's dishonest to list your hotel on Odisseias and have no availabilities and refuse clients to use their vouchers.

Wouldn't recommend it especially if you are coming from Odisseias",2 months ago,1

Bedroom... well my family could see me shower or bath. Wanted a whisky, they couldn't order this for me as it was only for their cocktails and refused and when we sorted out some vodka they wanted to charge me €20 for a vodka shot!

Trofa,hotel,Hotel Douro,Philip Levine,"It's 5 star for location, view and swimmimg pool outside (what you are really paying for) but I can't say anything else it truly 5 star.
Checkin wasn't ready and we arrived 3.25 (checkin at 3) and took another 15min before room was avaliable. Room floor on entry floor was still wet. The set up of the room is strange. Bathtub next to bed. It otherwise feels a little cheap in design or it's in vogue and doesn't work.
You have to get your beach towels from reception which we were never told on arriving (it should be standard explanation on arrival). So I was running back and forth to get them and they have a policy to return them before leaving. So if you want fresh ones you need to go back.
I couldn't understand the steam room so that didn't work. No one is about for help on that if so.
The staff are nice people but you don't feel they care much for you or your stay. Again not 5 star.
I did have a massage and that I enjoyed.

Trofa,hotel,Havay Motel,Veronica Jesus,"Locations is good but the swimming pool they advertised is not a swimming pool. At best is a kids pool, as the water goes a little over your hip if you're like me at 5""2,  otherwise it's like a pond and it's over your knee like my partner at 5""6... Very disappointed, specially at the price rate it goes.
The service window has a view to the bed which is very awkward if you think about people peeping out and it should be blackned out. The fountain is not a fountain as the water goes like a blocked tap. Water everywhere as you can see in the video and is so noisy that it might just be off all the time.
The ceiling at the top of the ""pool"" needs a clean and the table by it is just in need of a replacement, looks more like a table in an abandoned building... All peeling out.
Last but, not least, you can't book it, which makes your plan for a night out completely useless because you might plan the whole night, go there and the suite is not available... There it goes your night.
The swing at the Havay suit is really good, the cross is useless as you are either tall to be hooked from the top (hands) or short to be hooked from the bottom (feet) but not both.
The love sofa is awesome, the bed spetacular but it's about it. For the price, I've been in better places.",7 months ago,2

The staff was very nice and helpful. They have a nice backyard with a pool, and the dining room was very nice. My main issue with our stay was that we were offered dinner and a massage when we arrived. We agreed to dinner because we were tired from our hike, but we were not told a price. The dinner was a really nice 4 course meal, and then we asked for wine with the meal. After our meal we went to our room to sleep, but there was a knock and we were told to pay over €60 cash for our dinner. Each meal was €25 and the bottle of wine was €14. This is not super expensive, but most meals with wine had cost us €30 when eating out so we were very surprised, especially when our stay at the hotel cost €70. We almost didn't have enough cash for the meal. So again a nice place to stay, but our stay was ruined with the expensive dinner surprise.",2 years ago,3
Trofa,hotel,Villa d'Arcos,Victoria Negrea,"Okay. We had a double bed in a decently sized room. The shower and toilet were directly in the room (not a connecting area), which was odd. The pool was lovely. I felt scammed though as there were no prices for the mini fridge and we were asked multiple times to pay if we had taken anything. The host also said ""dinner is at 7"" implying that dinner was included. We ended up having to pay $60 for dinner and a bottle of wine which was not in our budget.",2 years ago,3

You’ll notice there are often two or three walkways on different elevations - that is very much intentional, since depending on the tide and wind the waves can EASILY cover the lower ones.

Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

Valongo,restaurante,Casa Pichel,kykon Tuga,"Sunday evening.
Table for 4 .
Good welcoming and starters were served . A few plates of different starters just to open . We order a Pichel Steak and Pichel cod .
To drink a Rose wine .
Good came and 3 of us shared the Pichel Steak leaving the cod for one person .
All amazingly good only thing I would add would be a few more chips in the Steak ( since they knew we were sharing for 3 persons ) but in the end we were all satisfied with the food .
One dessert and 4 coffees and we end up paying 15€ each what was a lovely meal for a fair price .

Valongo,restaurante,O Chefe Almeida,Joao Sousa,"Fomos visitar este restaurante num sábado pela hora do almoço. Chegamos ao local e o mesmo estava cheio, o que pode ser um bom sinal para muitos, mas não é algo agradável num espaço não muito grande, com muita pouca ventilação em pleno verão. Entramos no restaurante e é um restaurante típico de família que não saiu dos anos 90, desde a decoração, ao ambiente e aos pratos. Fomos atendidos por uma jovem 5 minutos depois de estarmos lá dentro sem saber onde sentar. Depois de sermos empurrados de mesa em mesa lá nos sentamos. Pedimos um bacalhau à bracarense. Não demorou muito a chegar a mesa, o que foi um ponto positivo. A dose de bacalhau deu para 2 adultos e 2 crianças. Mas não dava para repetir. Se forem em família e quiserem comer bem. Têm que pedir mais do que uma dose. O espaço estava cheio de diversos tipos de pessoas, famílias completas, trabalhadores, casais de reformados que vinham almoçar ao fim de semana. O atendimento era feito apenas por uma pessoa, o que atrasava um pouco, muitos poucos funcionários para tantas pessoas. Um funcionário chegou quase na hora de saírmos, passou de mesa em mesa a perguntar se estava tudo bom. Como tinha de ser não perguntou a nós. Depois de pagar viemos cá para fora apanhar um pouco do ar ""fresco"" de verão que era bem mais agradável.",7 months ago,3

Grande variedade de Cervejas de cisterna, sempre bem tiradas e geladas.

Excelente conceito, magnifica confeção, ótimo sabor e muita qualidade, que se mantém ao longo dos seus quase 21 anos de existência (desde 2004)

Excelente localização, fácil acesso e grande disponibilidade de estacionamento na sua área adjacente.

On my second year it was not so great , i was in a room with jacuzzi inside  where there was water leaking underneath the jacuzzi, there was like a big puddle , and i found centipedes on the floor around the jacuzzi!

On my 3rd year I thought I would have a better experience,  but it did not happen  ,  I had a terrible time , got into a room, and the first thing I see is water on the floor coming out from jacuzzi,  TV  not working,  WC without toillet roll...

Do not wish to ever use this Motel again , as they made me pay for a 24h room  , where I did not stay 24h only 15h in a different room without jacuzzi,  and with a bad breakfast service!!

The rooms have recently been renovated, and I've found our room to be clean. Our room had an external toilet/bathroom (it did come equipped with a bidet and a sink) shared by several other rooms on the floor, meaning you could theoretically end up waiting for a shower or a nature's call.
My biggest (and probably only problem) with the room was the bad thermo isolation, which made the room quite chilly (early December). An electric radiator style heater was available in the room, and setting it to max was barely enough to keep it lukewarm.

Is cheap but not that much to justify a broken mirror in the toilet or absence of warming engine.. We faced quite cold days and we didnt have even heavy clothes. In the hotel we suffered the cold unfortunately. The distance from the center is acceptable, near the metro station and bus stop.

The hotel's modern and elegant design, combined with its cleanliness and comfort, truly exceeded our expectations. Our room was not only beautifully decorated but also equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
What stood out the most was the exceptional level of service provided by the owner. He is always ready to assist with a smile, offering helpful recommendations for local attractions and dining options. His genuine hospitality made our stay unforgettable.
Additionally, the hotel's location in Porto is perfect, providing easy access to the city's main sights and cultural landmarks.Highly recommended to start with the highest level of the bridge - this made exploring the beautiful city incredibly convenient.

2. Location - just steps from the metro that will take you to Porto centre in 2 or 3 stops. Many very affordable and delicious restaurant options in walking distance. Supermarket across the street. The area is more local than touristy. So it's peaceful and quiet. Safe.
3. The property - it is located within an apartment building and takes up half of the 2nd floor. There is an elevator. The unit itself is quite large. I felt at home. The Guests were quiet or there is sufficient sound proofing.

there is no outside signage. You can't tell there is a bed and breakfast in here from the outside. make sure you notify the property or host in advance what time you will arrive and check in. The host will let you in the building.",3 months ago,5

The room was simple, but adequate. Shower worked well, and the room was also provided with a fan, which helped quite a lot with the heat.

Valongo,hotel,Hotel Areosa,Jennifer Sloyan,"The hotel is quite far out from Porto city centre and you need to take a bus then a metro to get there. The buses are very infrequent and you could be waiting an hour for one. The local area is very basic and apart from the metro doesn't have much going for it. There are very few places to eat and barely any pavements so you cant even walk too far in case you get ran over. It is very basic in terms of its facilities as the towels are on the small side and they do not provide toiletries apart from soap, which does smell quite nice. They don't provide you with a hairdryer either which I feel is a must in a hotel. The room is on the small side and we had to put our suitcases in the wardrobe to make space to actually walk around the room. The bathroom was quite nice and the shower was good but it had a tendency to flood the floor so we had to put towels down on the floor each time we had a shower. However, the drains appeared to be causing a bad smell to emanate from the bathroom as some days the odour was unbearable.  There were only two hangers in the wardrobe, the staff did manage to find a few more for us which was nice but there are no drawers to put your clothes in so you are basically living out of your case while you're here. The breakfast is extremely basic containing of 2 options of sugary cereal, bread rolls, ham, cheese and jam. We bought our own cereal to eat downstairs which staff had no issue with and we found the bread rolls were very nice but more of a selection would have been nice. It was very noisy and you could hear everything going on outside in the hallway and in the adjoining rooms. Also the key can be tricky to use and on the first day we had to get staff to open the door and this seemed to be an issue for other guests as they were quite loud and taking a long time to open their doors. They only have one key for each room so if you want your room cleaned you need to leave your key at reception. I wouldn't stay here again due to the location and poor facilities.",5 years ago,1

Valongo,hotel,Residencial Porto Novo,Martin Horák,"If you just want to have a place to sleep, be in the centre of all the tourist attractions/locations for the least amount of money this is your place ! Perfect for a group of students.

We we're a bit afraid from the booking Photos. We had room 102. We we're surprised that the beds and the bedding were nice and clean.

Sadly the bathroom didn't have any ventilation (there was some fan but probably stuck) so it was very misty and there were somewhere also pubes.. wasn't very clean, but it worked.

There is no AC and our room was getting quite hot so we had to keep the window open.

Sadly the hotel is on a really busy main street going on a bridge so it was really noisy all night Long with lots of loud revving bikes. Some rooms don't look it no the street so guess that's not issue in those.

This place doesn't accept cards so don't forget to bring cash !

The WiFi was fine actually.

It's very old fashion.. the staff depending on the Day (changing) were not caring or Nice.

Beware if you have big luggage. I saw that there is an elevator in the photo, yet there are actually some stairs from the ground floor to the first floor where the elevator is located. So I have to carry my big heavy luggage up the stairs when I arrived, luckily the staff helped to carry it down when I did the checkout.

Valongo,hotel,Hotel Jaguar,Audrey Lord,"We chose this hotel for our last night in Portugal to be close to the airport. I don't think their ""free airport shuttle"" is very useful since it only operates 8am - 8pm! That means it's only good for outgoing flights from 11am or later so you have time to get through security, or flights arriving by 730pm or so since you'd need to get your luggage.
The rooms were well stocked and included a fruit plate, water, and cookies which was a nice surprise! The rooms were clean except for a gross stainless steel toothbrush cup in the bathroom - who is using that anyway?!? 🤢
Aside from that, all looked good. Oh, beware about taking anything - there's a price list in the bathroom: $400 for the TV, $25 for the slippery mats by the bedside, some amount for the scale. Nutso. Who's stealing bathroom scales??
The common areas were compact but we didn't hang out there anyway. Street noise made it hard for my husband to sleep. Oh, and if you open the window it's way different than the USA - like, it opens fully, no screen, no safety measures to keep people from falling out!

Valongo,hotel,Axis Porto Business & SPA Hotel,Valerie Brotherton,"The hotel is very far from the centre of the city. We didn’t want to stay in the city because we only intended to stay 1 night.  But there aren’t any restaurants or shops close to the hotel so unless you have a car or use transit your options for dining will be limited to the hotel restaurant.  We ate at the lounge one night and it was not good.  All they were able to offer us late at night was a ham and cheese sandwich with potato chips.  The potato chips were the best part of the meal.

There is a 5 EU charge to park in their lot but it is a very steep incline to get to the lot and difficult to maneuver so we parked our rental car on the street.  There is no problem with parking behind the hotel.

The room was clean and well maintained but it is very small.  The staff are friendly and try very hard but we found not too knowledgeable.  We asked about finding a hospital as my husband had to go to emergency and the gentleman told us it was only 4 blocks away.  It was over a mile away.  We walked over a mile to get to the emergency department where we spent 11 hours.  We had to book another night because we were too late to get to our next destination.

When we called the hotel to book for another night they said they only had 1 room left but they would not hold it with our credit card.  It is against company policy.  If the room was gone when we got there – too bad.

They cater to tour groups.  There were 2 tour groups and the breakfast room was very loud and crowded with the tour groups getting ready to leave.  Breakfast was uninspired.

Fabio, the guy from reception, was very friendly and helpful, taking the time to show me around all the facilities. I was able to drop off my bags before the official check-in time.

However, the overall experience left a lot to be desired. The kitchen is *extremely* small—only one person can fit at a time—and when someone is cooking, the entire living room fills with the smell of food. The common bathroom was smelly and didn’t seem to be cleaned regularly enough. The back garden is a highlight, though—a peaceful spot with plenty of trees, including fruit trees.

One major disappointment was that the pictures in the advertisement don’t fully match the reality, especially the common spaces.

WiFi connection was great, but there’s no connection in the garden. The whole place feels old and in need of a good refurbish.

Valongo,hotel,SwissPorto Guest House,Bárbara Pereira,"We made a reservation for 17th of August untill 20th of august.
When we reached the place, there was a kid running around, barefoot, and lots of noise (even though it was our first impression, we still gave it a chance).
When we reached our room, after doing the check-in, we examined everything, and took photos of what was wrong (we do it everywhere we go, since it is a way for us to be safe).
To begin with, the room, besides the floor, wasn't clean, there were some dirty spots on the cover of our duvet, and the duvet itself was brown and dirty.
There was a pole, but no hangers, below that same pole, there was a really really dirty quilt, with many brown spots and dirty. There was also a bug squashed and dragged across the wall, and in the top corner a dirty rigid plastic cover on the ceiling.
There was a window, with a curtain that lets the light enter, even at night.
The bathroom smelled like humidity and mold. The toilet cover was broken, and we couldn't sit on the toilet itself, since there is a wall right in front of the toilet, which makes it impossible to fit our legs there.
The shower smelled really bad once again, from humidity or so, and there was a really dirty place/rotten, for placing the shower gel, shampoo etc.
The shower ventilator was supposed to be yellow, it was black from how dirty it was.
At night we could barely sleep, there was lots of noise, from people in phone calls, kids screaming and people going up and down the stairs.
We had 1 towel for each one of us for the 3 days we were there. The towels weren't changed, neither the bed  sheets. If we wanted to change the towel, we had to pay 2€ each for an extra towel.
We don't feel like the conditions we were in were human, sanitary, or even safe.",7 months ago,1

I had to take antistaminics due to an allergic reaction that also involved my breathing and my body is still full of bites and itchy after one week.
I left in the middle of the night disgusted and I reported this to the property owner that didn't seem to take the issue seriously, and he was also very rude calling me a lier until I sent him pictures. Bed bugs don't go away with a steamer, they are pests and a very serious hygiene and health issue, that I have reported to the relevant local authorities, hoping for further action.

I wish I lived here.

This beach in Porto offers stunning Atlantic Ocean views with strong winds and impressive waves. The beach itself is well-maintained and clean, boasting beautiful, clear sand perfect for sunbathing or enjoying a picnic.
I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of people here today.

There were a few people (men) playing volleyball in their Speedos 🫣, however, most people were wrapped up warm for this winter morning in the beach. The atmosphere was great and I could even see some folk down by the water getting their first dip of the year.",3 months ago,5

In our visit, it was rough and very dangerous with a strong riptide running right from the middle of the beach (check the photo), which was exactly where he had placed the safety flags for swimming. Additionally, he had moved his own station further up the beach and was playing cards with some friends, paying no attention to the young children at the waters edge, between his dangerously placed flags.

The food is good, in comparison what we had in other restaurants in the city center of Porto (also very well located), it lacked quality and love. We had croquettes and Burger on the terrace for lunch which was both good, but not spectacular and therefore the price is too high. For Dinner we had two starters and for main the 350g grilled Octopus (Shared). The quality of the Octopus was great, execution not so much. Way too salty and most likely not rinsed enough since there was some crunchy bits. Incl drinks 145€ was too much.",5 months ago,3

Valongo,praia,São Jacinto Beach,Stefan Bostock,"Probably one of the best beaches I’ve ever been to. Vast, wild, and empty (there were around 10 other people visible on the beach in later September). Could have watched the crashing building-sized waves indefinitely. They were so mesmerising that my partner passed out face down on the sand almost immediately. Meanwhile, not being a great beach Ken myself, I went for a jog up and down the strandline - it was magical and soothing.

Notes & Tips:

- Access: Walkable from the Sao Jacintho ferry terminal (~2km). It runs about once an hour from the Aveiro ferry terminal. I recommend getting here via taxi as ~€6 and the cycle would be long, hot and not very picturesque as it is through a port/industrial region.

- Shade: For pasty people such as myself, there is none. So bring a… parasol? Gazebo? Wetsuit and sombrero? Factor 50 every 15 minutes seemed to just about work.

- Food: There are a couple of cafe’s in Sao Jacintho, but nothing near the beach. Bring a picnic from one of the small supermarkets in Aveiro (I recommend the mini Mercado on Rua da Palmeira - simply because the guy working there was immensely friendly and kind).

- Swimming & Surfing: No shops or anything, so you would need to bring your own equipment. However you’d have to be pretty nuts as the day we went, the waves were monstrous and wild - a big part of the appeal. Saw two locals go for a paddle - but no one else.

- The Nature Reserve: Intended on checking this out alongside the beach, but could not work out how to access or if it would even be worth it on foot. Couldn’t easily access from along the beach (very wild - as one might expect).",a year ago,5

After reading other reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect but I saw several couples sunbathing naked and nobody was bothering them at all. I also saw families in swim suits having a great time, seemingly oblivious to other people being naked. Of course there may be days when a bad apple spoils things for others but when I was there, clothed and naked people both seemed to be having a wonderful time and I had a perfect afternoon feeling completely free without any clothes.

The sea can be a little rough but I enjoyed padding with the large waves coming in around me. It was also not obvious to find but Google maps directed me to the path from the road to the beach and it was easy to park the car next to the road.",7 months ago,5

We shared a large grilled seabass, commonly caught in these waters, and it was delicious and fresh, simply grilled to perfection. I also loved the clams, which were incredibly fresh and cooked simply with olive oil, making them so flavorful and tasty, full of umami. Paired with the local Douro River white wine, it was a fantastic experience! My other colleague chose the local beef, which looked delicious as well.

Vila do Conde,restaurante,Farol Vila do Conde,Henry Hjorth,"Sadly the absolute worst dining experience I have ever had!

I got fried sardines with single piece of salad and grated carrots - on the side was rice with beans. The rice and beans were served in a pot, with what looked (and tasted) like the ricewater from the boil. Both the rice and beans were so overcooked and it tasted just, bland… I tried adding salt and pepper to the pot which did not help. The fried sardines were stale and tasteless too.

Now comes the real disappointment; Never before have I addressed an issue with any restaurant food, but I couldn’t help it. I politely informed the waiter of the inconvenience with my dish, and he went to the manager. The manager would not discount nor compensate in any other way ~ at last, a younger, very respectful waiter came to our table, and was sorry for the situation. He too, went to the manager by his own decision, but nothing came from it apart from a foolish excuse, that they “use very little salt and pepper, because there are kids and seniors eating there”. yup, all the kids ordering the sardine dish wouldn’t want to have ‘taste’ to their rice😂 ~ next time I “should make notice of what I prefer before ordering”. I can’t even believe it.

I recommend you to never step foot inside this “restaurant”.",8 months ago,1

My recommendation:
Ask for a “pica pau “ this is the normal Francezinha city into little pieces perfect for a starter. Then for main askdoe the Francezinha especial a Mestre (the house Francezinha) with extra sauce (extra molho). You will not be disappointed.
Try their variety of sangria. A fresh compliment to the meal itself.",3 weeks ago,5

Vila do Conde,restaurante,Bastardos Restaurante,P S,"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.
Warm welcome, friendly service. Business ran with passion and heaps of creativity.
I was told the food menu was changed weekly and had to listen to the waiter recite everything that was available. I would have ordered every single item if I had the space.
Started off with a nice cold and strong cherry beer. That warmed up the chilly February evening. For starters went with oysters and the prawn bar buns. Absolutely divine. The choice of main courses all made me salivate but decided to go with duck breast, with cranberry sauce, asparagus and mash potato with added spicy curry. The combination was unexpected but the collage of flavours was something remarkably good. All of that complimented with a glass of nice red wine from the servers recommendation.
Finished off with cheesecake and a scoop of red fruit ice cream.
Portions are good , you won’t get stuffed which is perfect because you want to try everything they have to offer.
Without much beating around the bush this was probably the best meal I’ve had in Portugal and I’ve been coming here since 2012.

In addition, both owners were super friendly; we could talk well about German quality products (Thermomix) and there was also a port wine on the house at the end.

Basically 35 euros for roasted potatoes rice, some greens and bones. The person who I order from dissapear and so did the waitress at the time to pay. She barely came to the table. They even charged us 2 euros for regular (tap) water saying it was ""from the machine"". 2 euros for 2 pieces of old bread. I have dined  all over Portugal, this is by far the worst place.

The only pity is that out of the many options on the menu, only very limited choices were available. 3 out of 6 starters, only 2 fish options, only 2 meat options. I wanted seafood, but only 1  choice was available.

I had a chicken entrada, a selection of local sausages, bread, a caldo verde (veggie soup) and a beef steak (served with rice and vegetables). Together with a bottle of white wine.

The drinks were a bit strange, the cocktails we tried were both on the bitter side, which is fine, but since the sushi wasn’t sweet at all - it was more traditional than fusion in terms of flavours - the whole mean missed some excitement. But rest assured that the quality was incredible. Overall, it was a great experience.

Vila do Conde,restaurante,Le Villageois Restaurante,Davi Soares,"Nice food and comfortable place to eat.
I had a few issues with the bill, since a few items were charged from my group and we not even had ordered it.
The waiters just brought starters to our table as ""offer"" but we just found out it was not offer when we were paying.
They also charge the bottle of water without informing you. Just bring it to the table and if you drink it, you have to pay. (the difference was about 25€ on the bill)

Particularly I don't think this is the best approach to the customers, since we're not obligated to understand the internal culture of the restaurant and according to Portugal's law, if anything is brought to the table without the customer order, this item shall not be charged. (But then it comes a deeper topic and it's not worth saying).

Overall the food it good, just has this little management issue that really makes me think twice before going there since It's a little bit uncomfortable.",2 years ago,3

The service is poor. The Maître d' will not greet you. He will come to the table and ask for what you want. We ordered a variety of sushi and sashimi, when we questioned the types of fish between the prive and the standard, he didn't really know how to explain. It was a ""house thing"". They served Voss sparkling water but they only have small bottles. We stayed with cocktails for the night, and funny enough, the bartender was the nicest of the staff.

Vila do Conde,restaurante,DARZ! Hamburgueria Artesanal,Antonieta Ponce de Leão,"Maybe I had big expectations, or maybe my burger wasn’t that great.
I will return to try again, because with such awesome ratings I must be wrong 😅

I’ve saw this place on my friends Instagram and wanted to come here for a long time, so one day, we were half way from Porto and we decided to come.

I had the burger with Gorgonzola and my bf had the Melbourne (according to the owner, the most typical).

I had a bit on my bf burger, that really look delicious as you can see in the pics, is the one with the bacon sticking out 😛), and there was something there that was not my taste. I’m not picky with food but it wasn’t for me.

An then my burger, the Nürburgring
It is supposed to be a burger with string cheese, the cheese is the star of the burger, but it wasn’t… the sweet caramelized onion was the star, you almost couldn’t taste the cheese, as the ratio cheese onion was like 30-70. That really disappointed me. Just too much onion.
I feel they go a bit nuts on the onion 😅

The fries were ok and the portion is good, but the sauce was really great.

They have like 10 different beers, but they went a bit crazy on the prices, 6,5€ for Paulaner is a bit too much. The dinner got quite expensive because of the beers.

The toilet wasn’t as clean as it should be, and say this because they had just opened for dinner and we were the first customers.

I also felt that the bread could have been fresher.

The owners are friendly and super nice, explaining everything about the burgers, and what to look for.

Vila do Conde,restaurante,Praça Velha,Alan Wakefield,"This establishment seems to have had average reviews on other sites,  I wish to tell, that it's a hidden gem of a restaurant in a backstreet atmospheric ancient square. There seems to be an alfresco platform out front, that was not in use when I was there in February. The inside was decorated with subtle class with white fabric table cloths and napkins and the real treat for my tired arse, sumptuously padded dining room chairs.
The service was very good from the start. I booked online with Fork for 19:00 this was accepted by Fork and then within minutes the restaurant had called to rebook for a later time as Fork had got a wrong. At 19:30 we were the first in and the waiter greeted us cordially with a big smile. The cover of sheep cheese and fantastic pepper stuffed olives with mixed bread were delicious. We both had steak Jenny went with a port sauce and fries. I opted for steak served on a bed of turnip greens with mushroom rice. I don't remember having turnip greens before but they have an appealing bitterness a bit like that of tonic water but not as harsh as lime pickle. This blended exceptionally well with the dry fried texture of the earthy mushroom rice and for my taste the slightly on the blue side rare beef. The one let down to the ambience was the arrival of some guy who seemed to be a manager or owner dressed in jeans and a shabby dirty looking grey hoodie. Over all top marks to chefs and waiter.

When we were choosing the side dishes, again, we where told that they don’t have chips. The starters was served at 13:20 which was quite fast, and the mushroom was pretty decent, sweet and savoury. BUT the steaks only came at 14:10!!! Keep in mind that we got to the restaurant at 13:10 and we were the first customers in the inteire restaurant!!!

The steak knives were very sharp (as they should be), and they also asked us to pick our own knives so they wouldn't touch them. Another nice touch.

The ship (which is a new one, but built exactly like an antique one) is definitely worth a  visit.

Vila do Conde,museu,Alfândega Régia de Vila do Conde,Artur Victoria,"The Régia Customs Building - Naval Construction Museum is located at Rua Cais da Alfândega, in the heart of Vila do Conde, where the Vila -Conde  Naval Shipyards once worked. In the fifteenth century, the heyday of maritime trade caused a growing movement in the ports of the kingdom, to which the port of Vila do Conde is no exception. Thus, in this context D. João II, by letter of February 27, 1487, created the royal customs of Vila do Conde. The building suffered, throughout the eighteenth century, successive extensions to conform the needs dictated by the intense commercial traffic that was then felt. Over the course of the twentieth century, the building went into a degradation process, having supported the services of the Tax Guard and warehouses affected to shipbuilding shipyards. In 2001, the result of the Vila-Condense candidacy “Rosa dos Ventos” to the Urban Pilot Project, was fully rehabilitated and converted into museum space. The permanent exhibition patent to the public, assumes three strands, which translate the function of the museum: Portuguese navigation, namely the one that originates and destination in Vila do Conde; the history of the royal customs and its functioning, officers and out -of -finished products; The history of shipbuilding, types of boats built in Vila do Conde and its constructive processes.",2 years ago,3

Vila do Conde,hotel,B&B Hotels,Adéla Miturová,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel for nearly two weeks. The rooms are a bit tiny for two people, but they're definitely worth the price. The rooms were always clean, and fresh towels were provided daily. The housekeeping staff were also very polite and attentive.

The breakfast room was pleasant, offering a nice variety of options. The hotel provides coffee and tea 24/7, which, while not the best quality, was still a nice convenience.

The location is fantastic, with easy access to the promenade area, restaurants, a supermarket, public laundry service, and even a McDonald's, all within walking distance.

A special shoutout to Guilherme Nogueira, an outstanding employee who was always willing to help and incredibly polite, making him the perfect representative of the hotel.

Vila do Conde,hotel,Villa C Boutique Hotel,Alexander Lobo,"This a pretty nice hotel and super quiet if you want to have a good night sleep

The highlights first: breakfast was excellent buffet style 😋

My room was pretty cozy. They do a pristine job in terms of cleanliness.

This is a pet friendly hotel, which was a concern for me at first, I did not hear any pet sounds or found anything abnormal, which was pretty good.

Things that require some attention, on my friends room I found some mold. A little maintenance will be nice.

I requested a coffee machine in my room since the first day I arrived , because I like  to make my own coffee at night. It was provided the day before I was leaving. I was a little disappointed about this, but I know the receptionist did her best to help me.

More positive facts:

Front desk personnel is super nice and professional.

There is an underground parking garage, that's a plus.

The food in general is pretty good. Just be aware prices are around any USA restaurant.",6 months ago,5
Vila do Conde,hotel,Villa C Boutique Hotel,Pedro Lemos,"The bar staff are extorting tips and room the air con  didn’t work in the middle of winter. I suggest you look for another option!

I ordered a drink that was on the menu and in the end they wanted to overcharge me, which was not even a similar price on any other existing drink, after asking for the menu again and confronting the waitress she justified it by the fact that it was a special drink and because the one on the menu was sold out. This was clearly an attempt to extort a tip.

The air conditioning in the room didn't work in the hot temp and after complaining to the reception they provided a portable heater. They dealt with it as if it were a recurring problem, given the promptness of the situation and the fact that they didn't check anything else.

Access to the rooms is also a problem. Every day I got stuck at the door of my room and had to go downstairs to get my key card updated.",3 months ago,2
Vila do Conde,hotel,Villa C Boutique Hotel,Elric Legloire,"Mixed Experience at Villa C Boutique Hotel

Pros:

- Friendly and responsive staff
- Comfortable beds ensuring a good night's sleep
- Excellent location

Cons:

- Outdated and poorly maintained rooms
- Persistent humidity smell
- Thin walls allowing noise from neighboring rooms
- Subpar breakfast with instant coffee and seemingly store-bought items

While the staff at this hotel is courteous and quick to assist, the overall experience left much to be desired. The comfortable beds and prime location are definite highlights. However, the rooms desperately need renovation, suffering from poor maintenance and a constant humidity odor. The lack of soundproofing between rooms is also a significant issue.

The breakfast was disappointing, with instant coffee and food items that appeared to be directly from a supermarket, not meeting the standards expected at this price point.

Considering the combination of positive and negative aspects, I believe this hotel is overpriced for the quality of experience it currently offers. With some updates and improvements, particularly to the rooms and breakfast service, it could better justify its rate and provide a more satisfying stay.",8 months ago,3

The hotel should be pet friendly, since nowadays it is very common that people travel with dogs.

Great things:
We had an amazing time.
The bed is very big and comfy, the shower is great and the room very spacious.
Breakfast is very good, even lactose free options.
We had 2 dinners at the hotel restaurant, in a huge group, and we had a great time.

Vila do Conde,hotel,Autor GuestHouse,David D'Alessio,"WeHostel would be a better description of these peculiar accommodations.  Rooms are a private stay in what is primarily an office/retail building.  Case in point 1: you’ll check-in at the home furnishings store that occupies the ground level retail space (we also found many of these furnishings -with price tags- in our room…coincidence?). Case in point 2: A worker at the retail store checked us into our room. Case in point 3: there are no staff after 630pm so guests are left to their own devices. Point 4:  Our room was on the same floor as what appeared to be a co-working space wherein the same workers also shared the community kitchen and comfy courtyard.  And Point 5: rooms themselves have paper thin walls- they’re not structured for sound separation.  Thankfully our neighbor only had one late night phone call.
Accommodations are clean. Location is centrally located. Breakfast was nothing special compared to others at this price point. And also if you’re walking, they didn’t start till 8 am which is not especially helpful.
I don’t know how Autor could better give guests an idea of what to expect succinctly, hence this long review. For us, this worked as nice place en route along the Camino. But I left scratching my head about whether Portuguese zoning laws allow for the mix of all these businesses? -What amounts to strangers paying for fancy sleeping quarters an office space-  Or do they???

Josh at the front desk is one of the kindest and most welcoming I have come across in the hospitality industry.
The hotel is super clean and built for energy efficiency and environmentally conscious. Located just 5 minutes drive from Porto airport . It has some free parking spots behind the building and parking was also available along the street,
Breakfast was decent and they even offered to serve us before breakfast hours if we had an early morning flight. We were told that the freshly bakeded items they serve for breakfast arrived daily from the bakery at around 5 am. And boy, they were FRESH!
Rooms are large and everything seemed well maintained.

Only one minus. Neighbour had three dogs. They usually start barking around 9 pm for an hour or two.

The staff at the reception were incredibly kind and welcoming. Breakfast was delicious, though the selection might feel a bit limited if you’re staying for more than one night.

This Hotel was awesome, the stuff was very friendly and polite. Always smiling and helping us with all our dumb questions. The View is amazing, imaging waking up and looking out of the window to see that small city and the water. Sunsets are breathtaking.
It's a quite place with great breakfast and clean rooms.

The downside for some people could be that its a little off the action. Porto is a 25 min drive and pretty much everything else is a 5-7 min drive. A rental car makes life easier, but other then that, we will come back.

Thank you!",2 years ago,5

We have seen many hotels in Portugal which cost even half of this ex-Estalagem from 1975 (or so?): low value of high price (around 100-150€/night). Everything is worn in this place, before pandemic such places charged 45-50€ which says all.

Don't even think about to book one night here! You'll regret it!

It’s very noisy, the sanitary block is not very well looked after and needs some updating,it is very difficult to get round the site in a larger motorhome .. anything more than 6.5m , the pitches we were in were delimited which is fine until you end up with a very large noisy group next to you taking over several other pitches around you . There are some longer term pitches around the site which look really scruffy and numerous  dogs around the site barking and other noise going on well after the 23pm quiet time .The sunbeds around the pool were in a terrible state and need replacing .

It was initially dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption, but for a long time the only invocation is that of the patron saint of Vila do Conde, St. John the Baptist. Its construction began in the 1570s, referred to as already in progress in the Books of Minutes of the House in 1573, and probably ordered by D. Sebastião, who by missive sent in 1570 to several municipalities made known to his intention to fortify all of Larger coastal places from Cascais to Caminha. The fortress has five Baluartes, called St. Anthony, Santa Barbara (Terra -Terra - This and North), St. Francis, St. John and Our Lady of the Guide (turned to the sea - northwest, southwest and south). Three of the Baluartes have Guaritas, one of which the last to be built, the Santa Barbara, whose termination was reached only in 1793, completing the building of the forte more than two centuries after its beginning. The Fort of St. John the Baptist would have by this date bridge, freshwater well, house and headquarters of the governor, paiol and warehouses of weapons and gunpowder, dungeons, kitchen, fake door, chapel, artillery pieces, among others.",2 years ago,5

Vila do Conde,hotel,Hotel Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel,Mikhail Goussarov,"Friendly Staff and Convenient Location, but Some Drawbacks

The staff here is extremely friendly and always ready to help. When we arrived, the AC wasn't working, but it was promptly fixed the next morning while we were having breakfast.

The included breakfast, however, could use some improvement. It’s the same every day and offers limited options for those who don't consume animal products. On the plus side, we were allowed to bring our own food alternatives, which was appreciated. Breakfast hours are from 7:00 to 10:30, which is quite convenient.

The location is great if you're traveling with kids and want easy access to the sea or the pool. There's plenty of space around the outdoor pool for children to play. However, be aware that some rooms don't have balconies, so drying wet clothes can be a bit tricky—you might need to improvise in your room.

The rooms are clean, and you can request extra towels, sheets, pillows, etc., at no additional charge, though this is only available in the mornings.

One downside is the lack of lounge spaces suitable for working or taking calls. The room itself isn’t really set up for this either, which could be a challenge if you want to work during your stay. The WiFi is ok:

Vila do Conde,hotel,Hotel Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel,gforycka,"The Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel in Povoa de Varzim falls short of its 4-star rating in several key areas.

Positive Aspects

Clean rooms: This is a positive point and suggests a basic level of hygiene is maintained.
Good pool: A pleasant amenity, especially during warmer months.
Excellent spa and massages: A highlight for those seeking relaxation.
Negative Aspects

Below 4-star standards: This is a significant issue as it suggests a discrepancy between the hotel's advertised rating and actual service.
Limited ironing facilities: Only one ironing room for the entire hotel is inconvenient.
No late check-out option: This can be a major drawback for guests with late flights or other plans.
Repetitive breakfast: Lack of variety in the morning meal can be disappointing.
Poor bar service: Long wait times, incorrect orders, and guests opting for external dining are serious issues.
Unengaging entertainment: The described entertainment might not appeal to all guests.

After our meal we went to our room to sleep, but there was a knock and we were told to pay over €60 cash for our dinner. Each meal was €25 and the bottle of wine was €14. This is not super expensive, but most meals with wine had cost us €30 when eating out so we were very surprised, especially when our stay at the hotel cost €70.

Vila do Conde,hotel,Azurara GuestHouse,Afonso Bragança,"This was the best short term rental I've been. Where to start?

First, it has a great location right by the Azurara Beach (150 metres) and just 15 minutes away from Porto airport.

The room was very clean and big (20 square meters ~ 215 square feets) with private bathrooms. And those beds and pillows... So so comfy!

The host Silvia is amazing, communicative and made sure we had everything we needed. Even after scheduling the check-in for an earlier hour but spending more time in Porto downtown, we were able to self check-in with ease later in the night.

At morning, we were greeted by Silvia's smile and had a clean and healthy breakfast to kickstart the day.

Worth to mention that they have a partnership with a Surf School so I'm pretty sure that Azurara GuestHouse is the best place to stay to surf around the Porto area.

Will book again next time I go to Porto and recommend it (get a car so you have full freedom!)",in the last week,5

Vila do Conde,hotel,Guest House EÇA AGORA!,Den 98,"the house has 4 apartments. it looks very modern and simple from the inside. our room why left on the second floor and we really liked it. right after arrival the owner took us upstairs to show us the apartment and explained some rules. On the table was a booklet with recommendations for cafes, restaurants and a number of sights in Vila do Conde. The owner lives right next door so you could trust her recommendations. we visited the steak restaurant Bifeiros that she recommended and it was really delicious. The room itself was very spacious, very tidy and clean. what to note is that there is no air conditioning but a very powerful fan. There is free coffee and tea and cutlery and crockery is all you need. countless restaurants are within walking distance. It takes 10-15 minutes to the beach and 10 minutes to the train station. Porto is about 30 minutes by car and the airport about 22 minutes. Our room is really perfect for couples. the street on which the house is located has a great charm and is full of old-style houses.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no continuous cycle route along the coast to Porto and the drivers are not considerate on the cobbled roads. You can hear the airplanes and there are a lot of barking dogs around, but generally the nights are quiet.",9 months ago,5
Vila do Conde,hotel,Parque de Campismo de Vila Cha,Del B,"A great location for the beach. Staff helpful, some  staff speak good English others limited but, that didn't hinder their helpfulness.
Nice local restaurant, one across the road other on the beach.
It's quite a busy location with many campers moving after a couple of days. We stayed for three weeks.
The only real observation is that the toilet does not have paper and, at the time, not hand soap at the sinks.
The store on the site is adequately stored with fresh fruit and.veg with fresh daily bread. The on house restaurant, many serves home made pizza and drinks, which is handy.
The train station is a couple of miles away and straight linked into Porto, helps to get a free travel card and top up as required, one euro ninty sense gets you into Porto, the last train back from Porto is 2359hrs.

After a long day of travel to Gaia, we were fortunate to find this local gem right around the corner from our hotel.  We immediately felt welcomed.  Thankfully, they were open late.  We did not feel rushed at all and took our time enjoying our meal.

There is outdoor and indoor seating available.  During peak meal times the restaurant filled up quickly.  The food was flavorful, the ambiance was perfect, the service was attentive and exceptional, and the portions were very generous.  Prices were very reasonable for the location.

We loved seeing the crayon drawings of the owner's grandchildren hanging on the walls.

We had such a great experience on our first visit that we returned again for dinner another night.

Items we ordered and highly recommend:

Pão (bread)
Sopa de Legumes (vegetable soup)
Douada Grelhada (grilled Seabream)
Bolo de Bolacha E Carameli (carmel biscuit cake)
Cafe (coffee)
Bacalhau á Braga (fried cod with onion sauce)
Wishing you many more years of continued success!
And hope to dine with you again soon!

Obrigada",7 months ago,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Brasão Salgueiros,Tommy Levasseur,"Recommended by our hotel host, Brasão Salgueiros turned out to be an outstanding dining experience, combining flawless steak, traditional Portuguese flavors, and breathtaking views over the water.

A Setting Like No Other

One of the biggest highlights of Brasão Salgueiros is its stunning waterfront location. Arriving in time for sunset is a must—the golden light reflecting off the water creates an unforgettable dining atmosphere, making the experience all the more special.

Drinks & Starters
•	The white sangria was fresh, vibrant, and well-balanced, packed with seasonal fruit that elevated both the flavor and the presentation.

The Food: Rich, Bold, and Perfectly Executed
•	Francesinha: This dish often risks being too heavy or basic, but Brasão Salgueiros elevates it to another level. The perfectly cooked steak inside adds unexpected depth, while the rich, flavorful sauce pairs beautifully with crispy fries.
•	Oven Rice with Sirloin Steak: Though this dish took a little longer to arrive, the staff kept us informed of the delay, showing great attention to service. The steak was cooked to absolute perfection—medium-rare, juicy, and tender.

Service & Atmosphere
•	The staff was exceptional, providing warm, accommodating service that made the experience especially enjoyable for tourists.
•	The combination of waterfront views, a relaxed yet upscale ambiance, and impeccable service makes this one of the best dining experiences in Porto.

Final Verdict

Brasão Salgueiros isn’t just a steakhouse—it’s a destination. With expertly cooked meats, a standout Francesinha, and one of the most beautiful sunset views in the city, this restaurant is absolutely worth a visit. Whether you’re here for the food, the drinks, or the view, you won’t be disappointed.",2 weeks ago,5

However, I cannot say the food I had lived up to the long journey and price.

The place is rather far if you're coming from the waterfront, Vila Nova de Gaia, a bit of a nightmare if you're walking and staying north of the river in Porto city center.

The bill for 1 starter, 1 main and 1 cocktail came to €40. Not overly pricey but after spending 4 days in Porto, I now feel it was over priced in comparison to other places.

A final note, they only accepted cash when I went there. Not sure if this was temporary due to machine issues but would have been very embarrassing if I had not had cash.",a year ago,3

The food was magnificent and prepared with thought and passion , flavors bold and rich , this is a good place to eat family style, because you’ll want to taste everything. I loved how the wine was sold , there was a young wine wall that you’d walk up to and the bottles have a price tag hanging on it and you select your wine that way, there is also a old wine library (intimate size room, where you could even do a dinner party inside the room for 20 people) . There’s an open fire grill in the dining room and vaulted ceilings,that gives  the place a warm and homey feel. The cadence of the dinner was efficient, but not rushed by any means.

Greeted with a smile by the super professional and friendly staff, I was taken to the table and then got a tour to the outstanding wine cellar. I was amazed by the selection of wines from all over the world!
After seating everyone, the food show started!
From starters - the cold cuts and cheeses, the veal patty, the grilled chouriço, the wild boar stew and the “rojões” with chestnut were divine!!
Then we move to the main dishes… and was amazing food they were!!
From the Lamb chops, the “migas”, the beef and the unique cod with “alheira” we’re to die for!
Everything was cooked to perfection, well seasoned and super tasty!!
To finish we had a mix of desserts, including the famous turnips pudding. Yes, you read it correctly! Turnips pudding!! Amazing!!!

Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Taberninha do Manel,Matteo Parissi,"Lovely place and great atmosphere, you will be welcomed by friendly staff and the place, near the river, has everything you probably look for at display.
However, despite the beautifully presented food, we felt the taste was not as good as it looked.
The quality of the products in my opinion is good, the food felt fresh and I loved the richness of the portions. However, the seafood rice was exaggeratedly salted, to the point we both felt we had to leave a good part of it on the side (I have a much higher tolerance to salty foods than my girlfriend, even to me this was just too much), and the octopus was probably not marinaded, had a very simple-plain flavour, which was a let down since the meal looked delicious (more than what it tasted).
I still recommend this place, maybe the seafood rice was too salty just this time and also there’s plenty of options in the menu, plus staff is friendly.",2 weeks ago,3

However, I can only comment on the service, as I didn’t end up dining there. The person I spoke to, whom I believe was the owner, was particularly unpleasant and rather rude in his tone. He clearly has little interest in good customer service, choosing to make people wait inside for a free table instead of using a waitlist system, as other restaurants do. In the end, we went to Mar à Vista restaurant, just a few metres up the beach, where the atmosphere was much more welcoming, and both the service and food were excellent.",2 weeks ago,1
Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Aqua - Restaurant & Bar,Fábio Ferreira,"** BEWARE OF TOURIST TRAP **

Even though the place is on the beachside, this is the most authentic tourist trap you can find in the north coast.

I ate a grilled steak, a super common Portuguese dish, and faced the challenge of eating a 3+ day old rice. It was definitely stored with some seafood because it tasted like it.

The fries - another absolute disrespect towards the customer - were most likely fried with second hand or even third hand oil.

Atmosphere is good but the food quality is  embarrassing for a 4.1-rated place. It’s in a very good disguise because most of the people go to this place to have after work drinks while watching sunset.
Therefore, if you just want to have simple snacks and drinks, this is a decent place.

Franceshina and the tiger prawns for food. And the mix cheese & meat platter. Franceshina has a bit of spicy kick to it and the prawns were overcooked for my liking and maybe not fresh since it was sticking to the meat. Overall decent for a touristy spot.
Mix cheese and meat platter: meh nothing special. Don't order it :)

Service: 3-star
Seated by the stairwell because the upstairs ""was closed"" according to the waiter, but actually they let other people go up. So maybe have to request them if we can be seated upstairs for better views.

The food is amazing. The ""hamburger"" that is not even made with meat is still part of the TOP 3 burgers I had in my life.

If you are visiting Porto or live in the city, you must visit this place.

Finishing off the meal with some donuts it can't be much better than this.

If all Vegan Restaurants in the world serve food like this, I wouldn't miss meat.

Congratulations to the team behind the restaurant, and a special thank you to Vasco for the excellent service.

I am now back in Lisbon where I am at a restaurant that I thought was five star Degust AR I have eaten here in the past and it has been wonderful. However your standard is steps above what they can provide.
Experience at your restaurant was over the top exceptional. Staff from the young lady seating people, the gentleman that did the bread, the wine and the entree were a 10 plus rating.
Headed back to the US tomorrow I regret I will not be able to return to your restaurant until the next trip. I understand Portugal it is not common to leave gratuity. I left a substantial gratuity for the staff. My meal was €111 and I signed the credit card for €150.

Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Mesa com Tradição,Anne Todd,"We loved this restaurant and returned several times. It serves traditional Portuguese food, and the waiter took time to explain everything to us.

We were welcomed with a port/tonic drink, and offered brandy when our meal was finished. All the food was amazing, with large portion sizes. Good wine, lovely desserts (especially the mousse) — though the dessert selection was not huge, and I am definitely a pudding person. Some dishes need to be reserved in advance—we returned for a cod dish, completely delicious. You do need to order vegetables separately for most dishes (maybe not a feature of traditional food, but when requested, they were delicious. I recommend the spinach which I stole from my sons fish dish.)

Everything seemed clean. The washrooms were well separated from the eating area (several restaurants locally have tables right next to the washrooms, so this has become a point to check!!)

I suggest that you reserve a table here asap, before they become famous.",a year ago,5

The chef is extremely talented making home cooked simple dishes explode when flavour in your mouth. The crab cake starters are exceptional as is the pork knuckle main dish. The service is also very very friendly and attentive and professional.

I have to say that the overall price quality ratio is not bad. However I did not understand the hype of the tomato soup. Its just tomato concentrate with sugar and salt. Probably no fresh tomatoes were used in preparing the soup.
The pizzas however were up to expectations, it's a proper wooden fired oven and the ingredients are fresh. The tomato sauce and the cheese are authentic and only one person in my group found the pizza too fatty, with excess truffle oil.
The limoncello is nothing special and didn't try deserts.

Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Uva by Cálem,Ana-Maria Anghel,"Got here by pure luck, but it was among the places with online reservation (via Google Maps). The views were superb with the centre of Porto and superb Douro boats. But the food was awesome! We had a shrimp starter that was finger licking good, then the tuna steak. This is a must try! Coming with the veggies done in butter, they are a perfect combination.

Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Uva by Cálem,S Furst,"We had a great evening at UVA which was marred by payment issues at the end (see below for food review). When we presented our US-based credit card for payment, the waiter chose payment in USD despite our specifically stating we wanted to be charged in euros. When we got the receipt we saw the charge was in USD, along with a 5% service charge. When we protested he tried to tell us that it had charged in euros, even though it was quite clear from the receipt it was in dollars. A more senior waiter tried to tell us the same thing, until we showed them the receipt which clearly showed the charge in dollars.

This is called Dynamic Currency Conversion and it is a scam by merchants and credit card processors to squeeze more money out of you. You can Google it to learn more, but basically the merchant gets a kickback from the credit card processor, who charges 5% (or more) over the interbank conversion rate if you choose your home currency. By VISA and MC rules the cardholder is supposed to be shown the conversion rate and given the option of choosing local currency or home currency, but if the merchant doesn’t hand you the POS terminal, you aren’t aware of what is happening until after you get back to your home country and get your bill. By then it is too late.

It’s a shame that a restaurant associated with a reputable port house would resort to these tactics. So if you pay by credit card, make sure it is your hands on the POS terminal and not theirs…

————-

Dining review: UVA has perhaps the best piece of real estate in Gaia, with outside tables right on the Douro river and a lovely inside dining room with fabulous views of the river and Porto. Our dinner was very good with artistic presentations, good food and really excellent service. Add the amazing setting on a sunny evening and it really doesn’t get much better. So I was really disappointed when they screwed us on the currency conversion because until then it was a five star meal.",a week ago,2

Vila Nova de Gaia,restaurante,Taberna Londrina Vila Nova de Gaia,Diogo Borges,"One of the worst francesinha sauces I've had. Sweet and bright orange should have been a tell... the fact that this is a franchise coming out of Guimaraes should be another tell. Good selection of beers but one of the worst Francesinhas I've had in my life. The sauce alone is enough to destroy the dish but to top if off. Hammering a steak that we asked to be medium rare into a paper sheet beef that well done didn't help. Bread wasn't toasted (at all) and the fries are store bought. Do yourself a favor and stick to francesinhas from Porto/Gaia. This is borderline insulting to what a francesinha is expected to be. Taberna Londrina, as a success story in Portugal, I expect more of you, you need to be better than this, come on! (So sad.

The codfish fetuccini was awful, my husband just tried it and asked to change for chicken lazagna... It was not good too, he ate just half of the portion... And later he had problems with his stomach. And what was really irritating is the attitude...

Vila Nova de Gaia,museu,Porto Region Across the Ages,Melanie Mengüş,"We visited on a Sunday morning and it was almost empty. We had the museum for ourselves and enjoyed it a lot. The museum is an educational visit where you will learn about Porto and Portugal across the ages. We start our visit in the prehistoric period and follow the chronological order in the history. Each rooms are well themed so it makes it more enjoyable. We learned many things that we didn’t know before.

However, if you don’t speak Portuguese or English… this is not the place for you. They don’t offer options in other languages which is a shame.

But if you do speak either of these languages and are interested in history so it is the right place for you.",2 months ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,museu,Porto Region Across the Ages,Phil Bradford,"As an individual museum, this is expensive by any standards, but especially in Portuguese terms (€20). As part of one of the World of Wine (WOW) ticket packages, it becomes more affordable, and it is an excellent place for anyone interested in the history of Porto and how that fits into wider Portuguese history to spend a couple of hours. It is informative and uses a variety of media to tell the story, although some may find the section on the Middle Ages a little hard going (it is nearly all reading text, which I like but isn’t everyone’s preferred style). There are plenty of videos and audiovisual displays about some of the key moments in Porto’s history, and a few interactive displays to learn more. Probably too costly for anyone to visit casually, but worth it for anyone with a moderate amount of interest in a rich and fascinating story.",a year ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,museu,Porto Region Across the Ages,Rai H,"The three-star rating is due to the lack of acknowledgement of the pillage done to colonized countries. There were only boastful comments that showed one side of history rather than understand the harm that was done. In many other museums I've been to, panels on history are more objective, while this Porto museum sadly lack awareness.

€20 for a single visit is only slightly worth it if you don't mind reading many panels of text about the history. It's not for casual museum goers but can be enlightening and fun if you like to read. There is only a few interactive aspects and even fewer artifacts, making this a poor spot for children to learn. Despite the pricey ticket, I still enjoyed the tour, especially the documentary and some of the more colourful and dramatic personal history in the reigning families. It was only at the section on the history of The Age of Discovery that I was dismayed at the museum's lack of reflection, otherwise it was a good learning experience.",a year ago,3

If you're lucky enough to speak English or Portuguese, see if you can get her tour!

It's easy to get to this museum by walking once you go from Porto to Gaia. You can get through this museum in an hour, it costs 20 Euro per adult, and I think it would be interesting for anyone who likes natural history-type museums, and even if you don't have any interest in alcohol/drinking you would still be able to enjoy the exhibition from a archeological/sociological perspective.

The gallery has paintings, sculpture, jewellery, religious artifacts and all manner of items over 3 floors.

Some stunning paintings and astounding jewellery the likes I have not seen before.

I was very impressed.  My partner and I sent a good 2 hours here mea dering and learning.

There is also a small garden you could sit in if you decided to take your own lunch.

I especially enjoyed learning about the sustainable farming of cork oak trees and the forests they grow in.
The gift shop at the end was cool with a lot of nice products, ranging from just a few euros to over hundred. Average price is probably €25. The attendant, Sara, was super nice and helpful!

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Residencial Dom Duarte I,Konstantin Klima,"The hotel is in a very good location, a short walk away from the city centre. This is a hotel for those traveling on a budget, and not minding some negative sides to their stay.
The rooms have recently been renovated, and I've found our room to be clean. Our room had an external toilet/bathroom (it did come equipped with a bidet and a sink) shared by several other rooms on the floor, meaning you could theoretically end up waiting for a shower or a nature's call.
My biggest (and probably only problem) with the room was the bad thermo isolation, which made the room quite chilly (early December). An electric radiator style heater was available in the room, and setting it to max was barely enough to keep it lukewarm.
The staff were very welcoming and nice.

The Room was great. It was a room for two. It had dark curtains but I didn't use it and I'm glad I didn't because I loved to see the sun in the morning.

The location was amazing since it was near the train. I don't like Burger King but it was the only walkable place to get food at the time that I arrived. A lot of options to eat for breakfast and the view of the restaurant is beautiful. It's the top floor and it's all glass walls so you can look at the city as you eat.

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Golden Tulip Porto Gaia Hotel & SPA,Dan C,"The hotel is close to the beach and the customer service is good. It’s all downhill from there.  There is a lot of mould in the shower tiles and ceiling over the shower.  The A/C doesn’t work from the room itself, we had to ask the front desk to turn it on.  As it turns out, the A/C was showing an error message from their end and so they turned it on every few minutes after the A/C would shut off on its own. For €127/night I was extremely disappointed.  Some of the lamps don’t work as well in the room.  I will be requesting a partial refund.  I’m 35 years old and I travel a fair bit, staying in many hotels around the world, and I can confidently say that this is in one of the worst 3 experiences I have ever had in a hotel.  It’s by far the worst hotel I’ve ever been in when I consider the price.
Considering how bad my experience has been, I believe that many positive reviews on here with no comments added are false reviews. You can see by clicking on the profiles that many of them don’t have any reviews for other businesses. Meaning that accounts were likely created by a third party company to hired manage businesses’ bad overall review scores.  This is unethical.

The room is boring, absolutely no personality, but somehow made it look good in the pictures. The shower has 2 shower heads with 1 of them not working. We had to go downstairs and ask them to turn on the AC at the front desk, but it switched on and off every couple minutes. We called the front desk and they said they have an error and the AC does not work in our room. We did not expect the room to be this disappointing for €127 PER night. Luckily the front desk guy was very nice and welcoming. The location is okay but I would NOT recommend nor would i stay here again.",5 months ago,1
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Golden Tulip Porto Gaia Hotel & SPA,Sam Freeston,"I’ll start by saying that some of the other reviews seem a bit harsh.

The service was exceptional—particularly the gentleman who served us; he spoke every language of the guests in the room, and his English was excellent. The limited food choices encouraged me to try dishes I wouldn’t normally choose, and I thoroughly enjoyed everything, expanding my palate in the process. Well done to the entire team for providing great service, an amazing view, and very good value for money.",10 months ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Golden Tulip Porto Gaia Hotel & SPA,Stewart Cartwright,"I hope the owner reads this, I present my review with genuine desire to see improvement.

This hotel is an example of wasted potential.

In desperate need of investment as it could be the premier location to stay, eat, party, rest, play and explore Gaia Porto.

A few points:
1. The pool and gym are like and abandoned building. There is mould on your room, paint peeling from the poorly removed jacuzzi, the maintenance of the water in the pool is poor, the gym is low quality, the spa and Turkish bath are a safety hazard that will likely get you sued for an OHs violation when someone injures themselves. The control box makes it look decrepit and run down.
2. The outdoor area looks cheap and hastily thrown together with no thought or care.
3. The champagne lounge being closed looks like a horror attraction at a fair you go into to get scared for fun.
4. The staff seem so disengaged through what I believe is lack of management or ownership support to fix anything so they do the bare minimum.
5. Rooms are nice but the bathrooms are terrible. Bad plumbing, horrible shower set up with the silly small bath tub and shower head that's so low only a 4""5 person would comfortably shower.

I love the location and feel that whomever owns this hotel should do a facility audit, pull a plan together from feedback of guests, staff and the locals to have it be THE PLACE TO STAY IN PORTO GAIA

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Porto Je T'aime,Bodhi Reket,"Scandelous and childish landlord!
The location is nice with a supermarket right across the street but this is the only nice thing I will say to not let you be tricked in coming here just as I did.
I want to point out that I will only stay with the facts, so ignore attempts of the landlord trying to disprove my words which you see in other reviews.
Very soon after moving in I got weird bites on my skin what in the end turned out to be BEDBUGS. My housemate next to my room had them too, and another traveler that only spend one night in another room also had bites.
Now this can happen, what is unfortunate is a landlord that don't want anything to do with it and is only blaming us for the inconvenience. Maybe it is true that somebody brought it in, but maybe it is also just the whole house that is infected, as you will find numerous reviews with these compliants.
This does not hold back the landlord to keep blaming us for it. However, after still having to sleep 4 nights on a single bed in the same room I could move to another room while my other would be cleaned. What do you think (?), first night I got bitten and saw bedbugs again! This despite the facts that they cleaned my backpack, clothes and everything.
Then after asking for the single bed again to sleep on, I was forced to continue sleeping on the infected bed!
After I got away there they tried to hold back money from my deposit from me because, they say, I went away too soon. Which is nonesense since this was clearly discussed with the landlord before i went away. After a lot of ignoring me and the situation I got a 30minutes phone where the man is only trying to guilttrip you that you are just an egoistic person who only thinks about money and nothing else. There is no room for discussion with him. Eventually we could agree to make a deal in the middle. He immediately agreed to the deal after asking, which you would only do it you already know deep down that you actually don't deserve any money.
He is a master yapper who is very deceivable. PLEASE do not go here. It looks nice from the pictures, but from there you can't see the bedbugs and the terrible personality that calls himself the landlord.",3 months ago,1

Nevertheless, the rooms were clean, the breakfast was good (although I'm sure we could have gotten cheaper breakfast if we were able to easily get to a cafe or something), and it was convenient to get to Porto from the hotel.",6 months ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,"Forte de Gaia, Autograph Collection",Vi,"What a spectacular hotel! At check in we received some welcome drinks and our room was ready early which was very much appreciated. All the staff were lovely and pleasant.

We received a river view room and the views were incredible. The rooms are well appointed - I do wish the washrooms provided a little more privacy.
We received an anniversary treat which was such a nice surprise!

The location is great - the walk over to the city centre only takes about 15min and was very convenient.

Thank you for such a memorable visit in Porto!",3 weeks ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,"Forte de Gaia, Autograph Collection",Roderick Hsiao,"One of the most underrated Marriott hotel I've ever stayed. I've stayed at multiple high end properties and this is one of the best. Very nicely located - a bit outside of the super touristy place but easily accessible.

The whole hotel is elegantly design with lots of details. Great woody scent and beautifully design like a forest/tree theme. Room is extremely comfortable with great view. Super clean and neat as well, everything is perfectly position and angled. Bedding is very comfortable and even the towel is soft and comfy. Staff are so welcoming and warm.

Compare to other cities' 5 star properties, I think the price is also with high value.

Would highly recommend to stay at Forte de Gaia if you have a chance to stay in Porto.",2 months ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,"Forte de Gaia, Autograph Collection",Israel Moreira,"The Forte de Gaia is a true gem overlooking Porto, blending stunning historic architecture with modern luxury. Our room, like the rest of the hotel, showcased gorgeous design elements while offering breathtaking views of the city. The thoughtful staff had our pack and play ready upon arrival - a small touch that means everything when traveling with little ones.

Breakfast was an absolute highlight - the selection was outstanding and the service even better. The staff throughout the hotel struck that perfect balance of being attentive and friendly without hovering, always ready with helpful suggestions or assistance.

The location is ideal, with easy access to the gondola and local shops, plus hassle-free parking (a rare find in Porto!). While the gym was basic and the pool was temporarily closed for construction, these were minor drawbacks in an otherwise exceptional stay. The hotel's genuine warmth toward families and attention to detail made our Porto visit truly memorable.",2 months ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,"Forte de Gaia, Autograph Collection",Katherine Mohrig,"EXCELLENT stay at the Forte de Gaia! From the welcome experience, to the room, the view, the service, the breakfast — it all exceeded my expectations! I love that the hotel has gone to great lengths to have really custom, special details that are a celebration of Porto and Gaia (e.g., walls in the lobby feature beautiful cork, and over 50% of the world’s cork comes from Portugal and is obviously critical in the wine and port making process; or the golden river rug in the hallways and rooms for the Douro river). Just so many lovely touches!!!",a month ago,5

Bonvoy Platinum Member

I've been to 60 countries, and this property is by far in the top 10. One of the best situated, and immaculate hotels on the Bonvoy portfolio.

I'm at the end of a 3 week trip from Baghdad, to Cairo, Marrakesh, Casablanca, and then Porto. I wanted someplace newer and on the quiet side of the river. This place delivers.

Spend the extra bucks on the river view, you WOLL NOT regret it. I just stared out my floor to ceiling windows the entire time.

I'm writing this review while sitting on the bar, sipping on a coffee and having sweets after a long day on the town.

You are walking distance from tram (2min walk), bridge (10mins), and ALL.of the major Port houses.

I visited a different one each day. Ferreira is one block down, Sandeman is a 4min walk, etc..

The entire property is brand new, the restaurant and breakfast buffet get good marks. The staff is the strength of this place. EVERYONE greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome.

I will be coming back here this year.

FUNNY (TRUE) STORY: We were coming back to the hotel, and I saw this really nice wine cellar/lounge on the way so we took a turn to look at it, on the other side of the walkway, was an amazing lounge with a fancy bar, and I said to my companion ""wow, that place is fancy!"". She said ""that's our hotel silly, we're staying there!"". I was like ""noooo"", until I realized that we were looking at the lounge of our hotel from the outerside of the building.

To the hotel manager: Bravo, my friend.",a month ago,5

It was pouring rain and had no local internet so we could not wait outside forever and had to find a place with wifi to book some where last minute.  Any other place we've ever stayed at via booking there was NO issue and any other place with self check in sends instructions 24 HOURS IN ADVANCE because that's the logical thing to do, not hours AFTER the time they agreed to.

I have only one complaint about this hotel, the AC (air conditioning). It's locked at 19-20°C and turns itself off automatically every few hours.

I woke up at least three times sweating 🥵 just to find the AC was off. During the evening before we went to bed we were absolutely freezing 🥶 as the temperature couldn't be increased.

This is clearly a new AC system which either doesn't work or the staff is not trained to operate. I wouldn't stay here again if I needed a good night's sleep.... 😩

I got the feeling it is aimed more for business use rather than tourism as the rooms are nice but quite basic. Just a basic uncomfortable chair to sit on and 4 coat hangers - this is for 2 people staying 5 nights, nowhere near enough. Breakfast is very nice but can be a bit haphazard as to what is available at any one time, though I do not blame to staff as they are the same people who have to run the front desk, checking in and out phones etc. as well as look after the breakfast counter. But if you pointed out something was missing they sorted it fairly quickly. The location is very good, with the Metro stop outside the door, so very easy to get into the main parts of Porto, though it was quite a bit further to walk than I had anticipated, coupled with Porto hills it could be an effort to get back. Not much in the area - a few cafes and shops but nothing compared to the main areas of Porto so spent most of the time over there.",6 months ago,4

The hotel is also staffed 24/7 so you need to buzz the front door to get in which means it’s highly safe. The only downside is that the rooms are thin so you can hear people coming up and down as well as the shower being run next door.

Οnce we arrived at the hotel there was no help with our suitcases. The hotel is a three-floors hotel with a reception, but it does not have an elevator. This is not stated on the business page, nor on any sales page.(BOOKING,TRIPADVISOR ETC).

My 85 year old aunt had to go up and down 50 stairs every time she went to the room ,which was impossible in her health condition .I walked into the room with my husband and a strong smell of bleach was everywhere.There were 4 dirty pillows on the bed. The 4 of us decided to leave immediately and find decent accommodation in the city of Porto.

When we left the reception, Rui assured us that we would get a refund immediately. So far we have not received any answer about this.

Also I enclose the email sent from the couple who stayed back,they were also not so satisfied with their stay.
These essential deficiencies should be reported to every interested customer.

-We were a group of six friends travelling all over Portugal, we chose this hotel in Porto because of its high reviews.At the description of the hotel we did not read anywhere that there is no elevator and when we arrived there we realised that we had to carry ur luggage for three floors (including the entrance stairs) so the other two rooms had to leave since we had an elder woman that was operated at her foot and she could not climb every day so many stairs.
Our room was very small and there was no space for all of our luggage also we complaint at the reception upon our check out that the room was not so clean and the bed underneath was dirty we even found an empty bottle of water from the previous guests.",10 months ago,1

Despite our early flight, breakfast was arranged 30 minutes ahead of schedule, showcasing their supportive service.

If the hotel aims to compete with others, they have the potential to surpass them by enhancing their services and facilities.",3 months ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Vilar Oporto Hotel,Simon Patyi,"I was here for some meetings, and let me tell you, it's one of the best 3 star hotels that I've been to. The building is spacious, the meals are delicious and the staff are really nice (the receptionist helped me fix my ripped my shoe lmao). The rooms are made for two people, but the beds are separate so you don't have to share with your travel mate. The location is in the heart of Porto, the people nearby are quiet. And for 60 euros a night, this is one of the best deals in Porto.

I WOULD return! :)

Ps. give the receptionist a raise",5 months ago,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Eurostars Porto Douro,The Suitcase Couple,"Excellent experience at Eurostars Porto Douro. We were upgraded to a river view apartment room with a private balcony. The rooms were very clean and spacious and the breakfast was amazing!

The location is the best in Porto. Much better than the Porto central as the you get the best view of the Douro view and the closest to the Ribeira square: the most happening region of Porto. Overall, 10/10 experience. We also got another surprise from the hotel! They gave us delicious pastische nata (the famous portugese pastry), chocolates and porto red wine, with a very sweet welcome note! Many thanks to the hotel for this lovely gesture.

We would love to stay here again in future. If you want a full detailed review of the room, the location, hotel area and the breakfast area, then take a look at our Porto vlogs on Youtube @TheSuitcaseCouple (The Suitcase Couple). Subscribe to our channel to support our efforts!",a month ago,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Eurostars Porto Douro,Jason Jennings,Average hotel. Good service but average standards equivalent to a Hampton in the US or Premier inn in the UK. Hotel rooms are basic. Housekeeping could do with a kick up their backsides. Not feeling the dirty nails under the table. Location is stunning. Amazing roof top terrace and bar but not open during half term.

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,PortoSense - Ribeira,CHMO,"I stayed here for 2 days with my husband. The location is perfect, it can't get any better, though for the same reason it might get a little bit noisy. The window shutters were good, but they couldn't block the noise 100%. That wasn't a problem for me, but I can imagine it could be for someone with light sleep. The apartment itself was much bigger than I expected, very clean and clearly recently renovated. I really like how spacious it felt, there was plenty space for our big luggages and it didn't feel crowded. The bathroom was a little bit small and I wish there was more shelf space to put my makeup bag and other things, but not a big deal. There was even a small kitchen that seemed well equipped, but we never got the chance to use. It was really fun watching the crowds in the street and here's an insider tip: try to watch the sunrise. It was a truly magical view!",2 years ago,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,PortoSense - Ribeira,Shannon S,"I booked this place based off of all the great reviews, but upon arriving it wasn’t exactly what we expected and we didn’t actually end up staying here and booked a different hotel. The biggest reason for this being we did not realize there is no air conditioning, and while I know this is normal for many places it was unbearable with the heat wave. The spaces are very nice themselves but also note this is not a hotel and it is apartments (meaning no front desk). Something that rubbed us the wrong way was when we were emailing with them before we arrived they said even though our room might not be ready we could leave our bags when we arrived. We got there and there was a code needed to get in which we were never provided, so we had to call and luckily someone happened to be there to let us in and give us our keys, otherwise I’m not sure how we would’ve gotten them and what we would have done with our luggage in the meantime. The other downside to this place is it is on a busy street and people are constantly sitting on the step out front, and because they are able to see where the code is typed in I am just not sure how comfortable I would have felt with that from a safety perspective. Overall the facilities are nice minus the no AC but it was not what we were expecting.",2 years ago,3
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,PortoSense - Ribeira,Tamim Arif,"Unbelievable Location!!

The apartment is located on the ribiera, walking distance to most tourist locations. It is an old stone building on the exterior, but modern inside.

The balcony and windows have the kind of view poets write about!

Travelling in the winter, to what looked like an old building from pictures, I was a little concerned it would be cold. I should not have worried - it was well insulated with heaters inside, and very cosy. With all the windows, the apartment has great light coming in as well.

Travelers should be aware that there are stone steps from the street to the entrance, and then another flight up to the elevator - so those carrying a lot of luggage and/or strollers, need to factor in the need to haul stuff. For me, the elevator was a pleasant surprise, as I was expecting to haul luggage up to the 4th floor!",5 years ago,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Hostel Gaia Porto,Jessica Cheng,"Clean rooms, but can be improved with upgrades and refurbishment. We stayed for 4 nights and would have appreciated a wardrobe or a desk for working. There is a kitchen that can be a working space but not ideal as morning breakfasts can happen there for guests until 11am, and traffic is high as it’s by the reception.

Not the fault of the hostel but there is a lack of amenities close by. It is amongst several abandoned and derelict buildings. It is quiet in the night. Closest small supermarket and metro stop is 15-20minutes away, and the riverfront as well.

We had a private double room with a shared balcony access. They tidied the bed daily and provided clean towels every 2 days. Shared bathroom is not the cleanest but understandable as it is shared. There are signs of wear with peeling paint and broken showers.",4 months ago,4

A little out of the way for the rest of Porto but within 15 minutes walking distance across the bridge, you can have an old school hostel experience.  No frills kind of place.  Kids bikes in the lobby was a little odd but people need to raise their children.  3 bathrooms to the entire place, but no warning to one being worked on extensively when I checked in.  Creaky bunk beds, no individual lights and the doors do not automatically lock which leaves you relying on your bunk mates to be responsible.  They do remake the bed everyday and the people running the place are lovely people, but the photos you see on Hostel world and Google don’t jive.  Not a bad place but not the top of the line.  You can walk up tot he top of the property and get a great view of the city and find some peace and quiet during the evening if that is what you are here for.

The negative part is that they do not clean your room, make the bed or change the towels, although I suppose that if you ask them they will change them but they should do it daily just like the cleaning.

A cozinha está a disposição dos hóspedes para poderem cozinhar, se quiserem. Nós como foi curta a estadia, não deu pra muito.
Gostei que tivesse muitas fichas de eletricidade no quarto.

The staff are friendly and helpful and dealt with any query thoroughly and with ease. The rooms were good and clean, beds were large and uniquely designed however even though it’s not a bunk bed the beds are still connected so when someone near you is making repeated shakey movements, you can still feel it, but my sleep wasn’t disturbed by this especially since the beds itself was very comfortable. I really liked that the lockers were outside the room which means you can drop or collect stuff without disturbing the other guests. The breakfast a is simple buffet style breakfast with fresh items like omelettes made to order, you can eat with a gorgeous view. There is also 24/7 water and luggage storage available.

The room we received was on the smaller side, but very nice regardless. The staff was lovely and accommodating throughout our stay. The biggest drawback of this property is the location.

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,"Boeira Garden Hotel Porto Gaia, Curio Collection by Hilton",Deepa Arthur,"I recently stayed at Boeira Garden Hotel Porto Gaia, Curio Collection by Hilton, and while the property itself is visually impressive, there were several aspects that fell short of expectations for a hotel of this caliber.

The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with modern decor and all the amenities.

We opted to include breakfast during check-in after being told we would receive a discount for booking it. However, this discount only applied if both adults in the room booked the breakfast, a detail that wasn’t clearly communicated when we opted in. As a result, even though only one of us ate breakfast, both adults were charged, which felt deceptive and frustrating.

As for the dining experience at the bar, the food was passable but not particularly impressive. The service was also adequate, though certainly not up to the high standards I would expect from a Hilton property with service being very slow or forgetful on NYE. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t feel particularly attentive or memorable either.

Ultimately, while the Boeira Garden Hotel offers a stylish and modern setting, it left me with mixed feelings. The luxury elements are there, but the hidden costs and lack of attention to finer details in both service and communication detracted from the experience. Given the price point, I expected a bit more consistency in quality across the board.",3 months ago,4

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,"Boeira Garden Hotel Porto Gaia, Curio Collection by Hilton",Jasmine,"I am curious how this hotel is a Curio, I think DoubleTree might be a more fitting label. The exterior is undeniably impressive—stunning architecture set on beautifully landscaped grounds. However, that initial charm seems to fade the moment you step inside. While the staff was exceptional in every interaction, the interior space felt off, leaning too heavily into a commercial vibe rather than the stylish, inviting aesthetic Curio properties are known for.

The tone is set right away by the flooring—cheap porcelain tiles that undermine the upscale promise. The furniture, with its Wayfair-like quality, isn’t inherently bad but feels out of place for a Curio. The hallways are another letdown: oversized, under-decorated, and unwelcoming, with a distinctly corporate feel. Altering the lighting and adding more artwork along the walls could transform these spaces significantly. Throughout the hotel, there’s a lot of empty space, some of it awkwardly filled with inexpensive, misplaced furniture that feels uninviting and disjointed.

The rooms have a solid foundation but still fall short of expectations, especially for a supposed 5-star property. On the plus side, they did provide tarts in the room at check-in and we enjoyed the port tasting offered while checking in- it added a unique and pleasant start to our stay. However, the pillows, for instance, were not the large comfortable pillows you’d expect at this caliber of hotel. The bathrooms lack the creative flair Curio is known for—they’re too stark and uninspired- and the bathrobes weren’t replaced after use, which was disappointing. There’s no turndown services, and even complimentary water isn’t replenished daily. An extra chair in the room would have been a simple yet welcome touch. Even the breakfast wasn’t terribly memorable or noteworthy.

That said, I ultimately wasn’t unhappy with my stay. Everything was adequate, comfortable enough and at 33,000 points per night during the slow season, it was a good value, but I’d advise managing your expectations—this isn’t a true 5-star experience.",a month ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Hotel Cristo Rei,Rajat Shinde,"The location of the hotel is very good and central. Everything was at a walkable distance. The price is cheap. The rooms are very small, bathroom is not comfortable as it’s very small. Overall a good option for cheap and centrally located place. If you cannot adjust in small rooms and bathrooms do not choose the place, but with some flexibility for 2 days it is not an bad option.",3 months ago,3

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Porto Coliseum Hotel,Jamie Matteson,"Took a chance on this hotel after my original hotel said they had a lot of construction going on.
I am so happy we landed here. Traveling with my friend. Our room was HUGE! 2 beds, plus a separate sitting room with couch, chairs, lots of counter space. Tons of storage area. The bathroom was very generous.
Breakfast on their roof was included and the woman working the breakfast was so nice and helpful.
The theme is theater since it;s attached to an old theater.
Very festive in the decor.
We paid €139 total per night, so split, it was a very manageable 70.
Great  location, just minutes from Sao Bento Train, lots of restaurants, stores, etc, bustling area. slept fantastic on the beds.
Would def stay here again!!",2 years ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Porto Coliseum Hotel,Benjamin Heiks,"Great location for tourists looking to explore the old part of town or the other side of the river. Spacious room. Plenty of space for lots of luggage. Toilet separate from the sink and shower. Good shower.

We asked to get a taxi booked for our early train. We were told just to call down 5 minutes before, as the reception is 24 hours. We did but no one was around. Eventually had to call our own uber. We were nearly late for our train.",2 years ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Portus Ribeira House,Christian Verzino,"Portus Ribeira House was our last minute find and we couldn’t be so lucky. Conveniently located close to the best view of Porto, 5 minutes walk from the metro stop Jardim do Morro, it’s very easy to find. Caterina and the staff were so responsive to our messages and were so kind to let us check-in earlier.
The apartment was spotless and fully equipped with any amenity you may need.
We appreciated any small touch like water, coffee pods, biscuits, toiletries.

Even though bathroom and kitchen were shared, the other guests respected our spaces. We would definitely choose it again!",5 months ago,5

Highly recommended, and as soon as you leave, there are the best views of Porto.",a year ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Hotel da Bolsa,Ashley R,"Gem of a hotel with a great price and comfortable room. Room was very comfortable and had plenty of space. Breakfast for €12, which we did not have but was available none the less. Staff was welcoming. Hotel also stored our luggage. Two downsides:
1) The bathroom was not ideal because the shower has a glass panel and no full door, plus no ventilation, so the whole bathroom got very wet every time we used it.
2) The walls to the hallway were thin so if you are a light sleeper you would likely wake up. We slept one with earplugs and one without and had no issue though.

These two aside, the stay was fantastic and I would definitely stay there again.",3 months ago,4
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Hotel da Bolsa,Matthew Zakrzewski,"The hotel staff was very welcoming and helpful with our bags as we arrived before check-in.

The location is great and they have a fantastic gelato bar across the street!",3 months ago,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Hotel da Bolsa,Gabi Gabi,"It has 3 stars, and that’s what it’s worth. The room we had was spacious, if a bit outdated in terms of furnishings. We were in the 4th floor, but the windows were on the 4.5th, with little stairs leading up to them, which was a bit awkward, as you can only see the sky, not the city. The bathroom was tiny, but updated nicely, although you had to twist your arm when reaching for the toilet paper which was on the wall behind, but above / next to the head.
The location is good for walking the historic old city. Staff was very friendly. We had breakfast included, and they had lots of variety, even for vegans (soy milk included).",5 months ago,4

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Bella Gaia - Alojamento Local,simply woman,"Checking in was easy, we had agreed a time beforehand. It was a very friendly welcome and the room is nicely furnished. The bed is great for people who don't like to lie very soft. The bathroom was functional with nice decorations. Everything was clean and there is a closet to store your things. The rooms are quiet.

There are supermarkets, restaurants nearby and the tram to Porto takes about 10 minutes on foot.",6 months ago,5
Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Bella Gaia - Alojamento Local,B B,"We stayed at Bella Gaia Alojamento in the month of May, we stayed in room number 1, the room is very comfortable, clean and tidy, the bed is very comfortable, our friends were in room number 4, the room was a little smaller, the only handicap: the room has neither windows nor balconies, it only has a door with blackout glass and large windows that open from above, obviously we had not been warned of all this.
This is why I gave it 4 stars.
From the structure you can move easily either with the bus number 900 a few steps away which will take you to the center or with the yellow metro stop Joao dedeus about 650 meters away",11 months ago,4

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Timbre Heroísmo,Debbie,Stayed at Timbre to celebrate my milestone Birthday. The hotel is modern clean and spacious. We had a ground floor room with a patio area which was lovely to sit out in and have a glass or two. The staff were helpful and friendly. I was surprised with a complimentary bottle of bubbly on my birthday which was a lovely surprise and helped make my special day. The Hotel is ideally situated near a metro with a direct line to/from the Airport and was only €2.65. The centre of Porto was also just a 15min walk away. Good location and would definitely recommend this hotel as a base to explore the lovely city of Porto.,in the last week,5

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,Timbre Heroísmo,Manvi Goel,"What I liked about the hotel the most was its location. Metro station is right opposite the hotel at 2 mins walk, and hotel is at 7-10  minutes walk from the city centre.

I even reached the river side just by walking around and following the Google maps.

Rooms are pretty big,neat, but the issue was blocking view from the balcony. It's not interesting that way. Also, it is very easy for people from side rooms to come in. So, it's not safe, too.

Breakfast is OK. Not great choices. Simple and regular options like breads with spreads and cheese,  fried eggs, juices, and some bakery.",6 months ago,3

Vila Nova de Gaia,hotel,CharmGH by YoursPorto,Honey Pascual,"Room is big enough for two people in separate twin beds or a couple in a combined one. The room itself had nice interior, and it was quiet, clean and comfortable. The staff is amazing though, and made the place even better. The location is literally 1 minute from the Vila Nova de Gaia river, and it is walkable to many restaurants, Port wineries, etc. I do recommend maybe taking a taxi going to/from there because is no easy way to bring down luggage with wheels. You will be going through many staircases.

My one recommendation to the hotel is to have a light in the shower itself. It had very dark tiles, and at night, it's a little hard to see.",a year ago,5
